<br /><span class="small">TIME THINGS BEGAN TO MEND.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is springtime again, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m beginning to catch the spring
fever. I just feel&mdash;well, <i>torpid</i> would describe
it. I hate to study, or do any work
that requires the least exertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Billy, there&rsquo;s one great exception
you&rsquo;ll have to make when you say that&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
never let that torpor interfere with your rapid
locomotion when you heard the welcome sound
of the dinner bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat boy in the new khaki suit allowed a
broad, good-natured smile to spread over his
freckled face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different!&rdquo; he exclaimed quickly.
&ldquo;I said <i>work</i>, please remember, Alec, and as
for feeding, why, I always class that under
the head of undiluted, unadulterated pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, winter has come and gone, with a
whole lot of talk about town improvement in
the air, and nothing done, just as you were
saying, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manly looking young fellow who answered
to the name of Hugh Hardin was patrol
leader and assistant scout master. This
could easily be learned by any one at all familiar
with the various devices used by Boy
Scouts to designate rank. On the left sleeve
of his coat, just below the shoulder, he had
first of all two white stripes, and underneath
that a <i>red</i> first-class scout badge.</p>
<p>Hugh, as well as a number of other members
of the Oakvale Troop, had for some time
been authorized to wear certain medals signifying
that at some previous date they had
been instrumental in saving human life at the
risk of their own.</p>
<p>If the reader does not know under what
stirring conditions these medals, typifying the
Boy Scout Roll of Honor, were earned, he can
have the pleasure of reading all the particulars
in previous books of this series, as lack
of time and space prevents our mentioning
them here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Besides the leader of the Wolf Patrol there
were present on this occasion Billy Worth&mdash;the
stout member&mdash;Alec Sands&mdash;who had once
been Hugh&rsquo;s most bitter rival for honors, but
since heading the Otter Patrol he had grown
to be very chummy with him&mdash;and Buck
Winter.</p>
<p>They attended Oakvale High School and
were dismissed about half-past one in the afternoon.
They thus had considerable advantage
over the boys and girls in the lower
grades.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the late hour in the spring afternoon
mentioned, numerous little folks were
heading homeward in knots, having just been
given their freedom. Hugh and his three companions
had stopped to chat, having met by
accident at that point where traffic was congested&mdash;the
wagons from the mills crossing
in one direction and many big and little cars
swinging around various corners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Somehow or other that particular spot always
had a peculiar sort of fascination for
Hugh. It had tragic memories, too, for on
several occasions serious accidents had occurred
here, owing to the speed which some
drivers persisted in making while approaching
the dangerous crossing.</p>
<p>When Buck Winter, the boy who surpassed
most of his chums in animal photography,
spoke to Hugh about the dim prospect of anything
being done in the matter of improving
certain glaring defects in the government of
the town, the scout master frowned and shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything hang fire like this,&rdquo;
he remarked, at the same time watching what
was going on close by with keen interest.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that crossing over yonder, and some
other bad places where children pass over several
times a day&mdash;it ought to be protected but
it isn&rsquo;t. An officer should be stationed there
morning, noon and night, to see that traffic
slows up when the children are going and coming
from school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Hugh,&rdquo; burst out the impulsive
Billy, whose heart was just as big as his
waist was expansive, &ldquo;and some of these fine
days there&rsquo;s going to be something awful happening
here! It&rsquo;ll wake this sleepy old town
up! For one, I don&rsquo;t believe in waiting till
your horse is stolen before you think to lock
the stable door. &lsquo;A stitch in time saves nine,&rsquo;
they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see how the driver of that big touring
car swings down with a rush, will you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Alec, indignantly. &ldquo;He sounds his
siren to beat the band, just as if he expected
everybody to scatter like chickens crossing a
road, and run for their lives. It&rsquo;s a beastly
shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; said
Hugh, with compressed lips, and a flash in his
eye that spoke volumes, as he looked after the
reckless chauffeur of the car, now speeding
away, with a nasty grin of conscious superiority
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was the mayor of this burgh in place
of spineless old Strunk,&rdquo; the impetuous Alec
went on to exclaim, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d soon hear something
pop. I would call the Council in session,
and have ordinances passed that would
keep these speeders under control. After a
few of them had been locked up for a spell,
as well as heavily fined, you&rsquo;d notice a big difference.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t all, by any means,&rdquo; Hugh chimed
in, watching the approach of a bevy of small
school girls with apprehension, for the traffic
seemed to be at its heaviest. &ldquo;There are a
number of other bad spots in town that need
attention. The railroad crossing is utterly unprotected,
and last summer one man was killed
there, you remember, while twice vehicles have
been wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some other things you mentioned
the last time we talked this over, Hugh,
I remember,&rdquo; said Buck Winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of them,&rdquo; came the ready reply. &ldquo;The
whole town has grown careless again. True,
people don&rsquo;t litter the streets with waste paper
now that they know about the cans placed for
such trash&mdash;the scouts cured that evil&mdash;but
there are other defects that ought to be attended
to. For instance, some people persist
in keeping garbage standing open for the flies
to breed in. Others have nuisances about
which their neighbors hate to complain of. I
know six or seven places where this sort of
thing is going on, and I reckon the scouts could
trace dozens, if once they had the authority to
start in on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess I know what you&rsquo;ve got in
mind, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, with sudden
animation. &ldquo;I was reading the other day how
that very thing is being carried out with great
success right down in New York City. Boys
are given badges to wear, and are called the
Auxiliary Police, or something like that. They
have their precincts to watch, and report every
sort of nuisance or infraction of the law to
their friend, the police captain, who sees that
it is abated. They say you would be surprised
to see how well the boys do their duty. Things
have taken on a new look since the scheme was
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be done here a whole lot easier
than in such a big city,&rdquo; affirmed Hugh, eagerly.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got such a raft of ignorant
foreigners to handle, you see. A good
many people up here have just fallen into careless
ways, and all they need is to be waked
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did that other job first class,&rdquo; said
Billy, proudly, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d win out again if only
we had half a chance. But I don&rsquo;t know what
keeps on interfering. They must be asleep,
and only some terrible accident will startle
them to action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the boys have told me in secret
about a blind tiger that is being operated since
the saloons were shut out of Oakvale,&rdquo; declared
Hugh. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve also learned that
some of the mill hands get together and gamble,
which is against the law. The police,
thinking of the votes those fellows can control,
seem to wink at such things. There&rsquo;s
no use talking, the women of Oakvale have got
to be roused, and join hands with every church
in town to clean up the place again, this time
for good. The scouts stand ready to do their
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time!&rdquo; added Billy, sonorously, as
he whacked Buck Winter on his back, as if to
emphasize his remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are heaps of things that ought to be
bettered,&rdquo; asserted Alec. &ldquo;They never will be
until the scouts and the women join hands
with all the good people of Oakvale for a genuine
old clean-up time. All they seem to want
is a leader. Everybody is waiting for some
one else to make the start. Hugh, I wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised if it&rsquo;s going to be up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with Professor Marvin, the
school principal, only yesterday,&rdquo; said the scout
master, &ldquo;and he agreed with me that there
was great need of all the moral forces in the
community uniting for a big fight before
things got too bad. He said he would see
Mayor Strunk last night, and asked me, as acting
in place of Lieutenant Denmead, who is
away, to drop around to his house this evening,
for he had invited the mayor, Mrs. Marsh and
several of the leading ladies of the T. I. A., to
take supper with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for that!&rdquo; cried Billy. &ldquo;Make sure
you rub it in like everything, Hugh, once you
get the chance. I hope to hear great news tomorrow
morning, and I&rsquo;ll be ready, for one, to
take off my coat and get busy with a broom&mdash;of
course, figuratively speaking, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec nodded his head as if pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something in the air tells me there are going
to be warm doings in this town before a
great while,&rdquo; he asserted positively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always
darkest before dawn, they say, and things
have about reached their limit here. Once the
new broom gets agoing it&rsquo;ll sweep out a lot of
nuisances that have been an eyesore to all decent
people for a long while back. My folks
get quite worked up every time they begin to
talk about certain things that are objectionable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to begin and make a list of nuisances
right off,&rdquo; said Buck Winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like the way you look at me
when you say that, Buck,&rdquo; complained Billy,
in affected uneasiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to reform,
sure I am. Gimme half a chance, and I&rsquo;ll
even try to reduce my weight, if that bothers
you, though I&rsquo;d hate to cut my rations down to
half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look at all those vehicles and cars
coming along from four directions at once!&rdquo;
exclaimed Alec. &ldquo;That bunch of kids on the
curb has been waiting all of five minutes for
a half-decent chance to cross, but do you see
any driver holding up to let them go over?
They&rsquo;re a lot of selfish and reckless&mdash;&mdash; Say,
hold on, kids, don&rsquo;t you dare to try it! Oh!
Hugh, look there, one of them has run out!
Hi! hi! Hold your horses&mdash;stop that car!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">HELP WANTED.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh Hardin was known to be a boy of action.
When other fellows were stupefied by
some sudden peril, Hugh was doing things.</p>
<p>So in the present instance. He saw the peril
of the child even before Alec did, but without
uttering a single word, Hugh darted forward
as an arrow from the bow, or a hawk pouncing
upon some bird.</p>
<p>It was all over in a flash. Alec and the
others had started to jump forward, but they
would have been too late to be of any real service.
Hugh, however, darted in among the
congested wagons and moving cars, and,
snatching the frightened little child from under the
very hoofs of a team, carried her across
to the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>There was considerable confusion, for drivers
were shouting at each other and chauffeurs
were trying to push their way past the congested
crossing. Apparently they were more
concerned with the fact that there had been a
mix-up than because a precious human life had
just been in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Alec, backed by the other two scouts,
pushed out on the street and held up their
hands to stop the traffic until the cluster of
school children could cross. Some of the
drivers seemed to think it a joke, being held up
in this fashion by boys in khaki, and laughed
good-naturedly at it; but others swore, and
made threatening gestures with their whips.</p>
<p>Then, the children having crossed in safety,
thanks to their protectors, Alec gave the signal
for the wagons and cars to proceed with
as much show of authority as any member of
the traffic squad in a great city could assume.</p>
<p>The boys were &ldquo;boiling over&rdquo; with indignation,
as Billy aptly expressed it, as they walked
down the street toward the heart of Oakvale.
More than ever, Hugh was now determined
not to rest until something had been done toward
an eradication of the numerous nuisances
that infested the town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to attend that little, informal
meeting to-night, boys,&rdquo; he told his chums,
&ldquo;and unless I miss my guess something will be
done. If only the women folks can stir up
Mayor Strunk! I understand that several of
the pastors will drop in during the evening,
and it begins to look as though the last straw
has been put on the camel&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; ventured Billy, wheezing
still from his recent violent exertions, &ldquo;that
some of them had seen what happened just
now, and how that poor little Anita Burns
would most likely have been run over but for
Hugh here. It was an object lesson that might
have moved even such an old mossback as
Mayor Strunk, or Chief Wallis, of the police
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; was what Hugh told him, and a
short time later the group separated.</p>
<p>Hugh performed the errand that had taken
him to the business section of town, and then,
inspired by a desire to do a little preliminary
work along the lines he had had in mind, he
dropped over and greeted the head of the local
police.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Chief Waller liked Hugh, for he knew what
a manly young fellow the other had always
proven himself to be. Besides, Hugh was
something of a favorite with the better element
of Oakvale&rsquo;s population. He had led a
number of movements that, by their success,
had brought more or less fame to Oakvale,
particulars of which may be found in the
earlier books of this series.</p>
<p>So Hugh, using considerable diplomacy, began
talking about other things, and after he
managed to get the chief in good humor, he
introduced the subject that was nearest his
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women are bound to have the town
cleaned up, Chief,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;and
you know that when they once set their minds
on anything it&rsquo;s got to happen. They expect
to have all sorts of help from you and your
men; and the scouts mean to offer their services
as they did once before. It&rsquo;s a great thing
to be on the winning side, Chief, so I heard
Doctor Kane say to the minister the other day
when they were talking over this very matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Now, the Chief was a shrewd man. He
knew on which side his bread was buttered.
It was true that the politicians and their votes
had put him in his present comfortable berth,
but the Chief was a married man, and he realized
from experience that the home &ldquo;influence&rdquo;
could be counted on to sway elections
when once the people were thoroughly aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just this about it, Hugh,&rdquo; he said,
impressively. &ldquo;If the women want a clean
town, they&rsquo;re going to have it, and nothing can
stop them. If they get this movement started
they can count on the police backing &rsquo;em up.
All we want is to know just where we stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Hugh went on to tell what
he had read about the boys of the big metropolis
being made Auxiliary Police, and wearing
badges that were meant to be respected by the
populace.</p>
<p>Chief Wallis apparently had never read
about the movement. He seemed to be interested,
however, for it was plain to be seen that
if things had to be done that offended the
politicians, there would be a scapegoat handy
on whose shoulders the blame could be cast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, to tell you the truth, Hugh, that
isn&rsquo;t such a bad idea,&rdquo; he went on to say.
&ldquo;Boys can find out heaps of things that are
beyond my men; and once we learned about
these nuisances we&rsquo;d soon abate &rsquo;em. All we
want is to be shown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Hugh understood well enough that the police
knew about most of those infractions of
the law, but that for various reasons they had
pretended not to see them. If only the moral
elements of the town were aroused, and firmly
demanded a cessation of the law breaking, no
doubt the scales would fall from the eyes of
the police like magic. It always happens that
way, Hugh understood.</p>
<p>Still, Hugh felt that he had gained a point
in arousing the interest of the head of the
police. It was better to have a combined force
working against the evils than a divided one.
If the officer realized that his retention in
office depended on his active co-operation with
the ladies&rsquo; league, and the various associations
connected with the town churches, he would
work like a beaver to do his duty.</p>
<p>After leaving Police Headquarters, Hugh
started for his home. His mind, very naturally,
was filled with the matters that just then
took precedence above all others. Since the
preceding fall, Hugh had been trying to figure
out how things could be brought to a focus,
for they seemed to gradually get worse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>He was in sight of the white picket fence
enclosing the Hardin grounds when he heard
his name called in a boy&rsquo;s voice. Turning
around, he discovered that it was Tom Sherwood,
one of the members of the Otter Patrol,
who came hurrying along in his wake.</p>
<p>Tom had long been known as an exponent
of water athletics and surveying. He meant
to become a civil engineer when he left school,
and anything connected with this work always
interested the boy greatly.</p>
<p>More than a few times, when others of the
scouts would go off on a junketing trip such
as a school picnic, Tom might have been seen
tramping across lots, with a theodolite over his
shoulder, accompanied by some boy he had influenced
to assist him as chain bearer&mdash;bound
to some field where he could practice his pet
hobby to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Hugh noticed that Tom had a long face
when he drew near. This surprised him because
as a rule the other was a cheery fellow,
and wont to give back smile for smile. It also
told Hugh that Tom must have followed him
with some purpose in view, for somehow a
number of the members of the troop seemed
to consider Hugh in the light of a mentor, and
often came to him for advice, strange as it
might seem, considering the fact that they
were all boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Tom! What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; he
called out, as the other scout drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get my breath a bit, Hugh, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you,&rdquo; panted Tom, which fact seemed to
prove that he must have run quite some distance
in order to overtake the scout master.</p>
<p>Possibly his mind being so filled with the
idea of town improvement and the contemplated
uplift movement, Hugh immediately
began to wonder if the agitation of his boy
friend could spring from anything he had
learned bearing on this subject.</p>
<p>At any rate, he would soon know, for Tom
was getting his breath back again. He looked
confused, almost ashamed, Hugh thought.
There was an expression amounting to positive
pain on his face, and it also showed in
the way he eyed Hugh, as if he hardly knew
where to begin.</p>
<p>They leaned against the nearby fence, as
boys are wont to do when talking. Presently
Tom broke the silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re wondering what under
the sun I&rsquo;m going to say, Hugh. I can see it
in your eyes. Well, I had made up my mind
to ask your advice the very next time I saw
you, because I happen to know you&rsquo;ve managed
to get a number of other fellows out of
bad holes before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve certainly got me guessing
good and hard, Tom,&rdquo; said Hugh, with a smile
of encouragement. &ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s anything
I can do to help out, tell me what&rsquo;s gone wrong
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom drew an extra long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is, Hugh, I&rsquo;m worried
about Benjy, and as I haven&rsquo;t any father
to go to, and women don&rsquo;t understand boys
as well as men do, I hardly knew who to talk
it over with till I happened to think of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was immediately interested, though
at the same time relieved to know that Tom
was not in any trouble on his own account.
Benjy Sherwood was the younger brother of
Tom, a bright, aggressive sort of boy, whose
faults possibly lay along the line of wanting
to have his own way most of the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been doing to bother you so,
Tom?&rdquo; Hugh asked, quietly and soothingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know that Benjy is a pretty high-spirited
boy,&rdquo; began Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to check
him several times, but he just won&rsquo;t listen to
me, and in so many words gives me to understand
he knows his own business, and that I&rsquo;d
better attend to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s generally the way with
younger brothers,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Lots of the
fellows will tell you that. So far as I&rsquo;ve seen,
Benjy is no different from the rest. It&rsquo;s too
bad he hasn&rsquo;t a father, though, because as you
said, I believe a man can control such high-spirited
boys a lot better than most mothers,
who don&rsquo;t exactly understand how a boy feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the way it stands,&rdquo; continued
Tom confidentially. &ldquo;Benjy has been giving
mother and me more or less anxiety by going
with several fellows that I don&rsquo;t approve of at
all. I happen to know he&rsquo;s been smoking cigarettes.
I didn&rsquo;t dare tell mother. She has
such a silly dislike for tobacco in every shape,
you know. Worse than that, I&rsquo;m afraid Benjy
has been led into playing cards for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh shook his head as though worried at
hearing this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reasons have you for saying that,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Several,&rdquo; the other immediately replied.
&ldquo;For one thing, I found part of a burned card
in our kitchen stove one day not long ago. I
supposed Benjy discovered he had it in his
pocket, and wanted to destroy it before some
one found it on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be so,&rdquo; Hugh mused, &ldquo;and then
again he might have had some better reason
for wanting to get rid of the cards. Perhaps
he&rsquo;s realized, that he was doing something that
would grieve his mother, and so made a clean
sweep of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I could believe that, Hugh. I&rsquo;m
a whole lot afraid Benjy doesn&rsquo;t give up things
he likes so easily. Then there was another
suspicious circumstance. I&rsquo;ll tell you about
it, Hugh. Just three days ago I found that
Benjy had gone and opened his little savings
bank at home, in which I knew he had something
like three dollars, which he had been laying
up towards his summer vacation down at
the seashore. When I asked him what he had
done with the money he got red in the face,
and told me hurriedly that the money was his,
and he guessed he could do what he pleased
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you fear he has used it to pay some
debt he owed over the cards&mdash;is that it, Tom?&rdquo;
asked the scout master, secretly afraid lest
there might be some truth back of Tom&rsquo;s declaration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what flashed through my mind,
Hugh,&rdquo; the other confessed; &ldquo;and, oh, you
can&rsquo;t understand how it&rsquo;s worried me! Why,
I&rsquo;ve laid awake nights since then wondering
what I could do to save poor Benjy. In spite
of his high temper, he&rsquo;s a fine boy, if I do say
it myself, and I love him with my whole heart
and soul. Mother almost worships him. You
know he looks so like father! And, Hugh, the
idea struck me that perhaps you could think of
some way we might make him change his
habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh would not have been human if he did
not feel highly complimented by this blind faith
that Tom Sherwood seemed to feel toward him.
At the same time, it added to the burdens he
was bearing; for as assistant scout master,
with Lieutenant Denmead, the regular official
head of the troop, away from town so often,
it seemed as though Hugh had more than his
share of trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do all I can to help you out, Tom,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Perhaps I may find a good chance to
talk with Benjy, and get him interested in the
scout movement, for he&rsquo;s really old enough
now to think of joining the troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could only do that, Hugh, I&rsquo;m sure
it would make a great difference,&rdquo; Tom hastened
to exclaim. &ldquo;Joining the scouts has
been a good thing for thousands of boys all
over the country. They are put on their
honor. No fellow can subscribe to the twelve
cardinal rules of the organization with his
whole heart and still do things that he would
be ashamed to have his folks at home know.
I hope you can coax Benjy into joining. I tried
it once or twice, but somehow he didn&rsquo;t seem
to enthuse worth a cent. But there&rsquo;s Benjy
coming down the street right now. Guess I&rsquo;ll
be going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said Hugh, as he shook
hands with Tom, who was turning away.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some experience in approaching fellows
who pretend to scoff at scout doings, and
perhaps I can manage Benjy. I&rsquo;m glad you
spoke to me, Tom. Be sure it&rsquo;ll go no further.
So-long! Meeting to-morrow night,
remember!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Hugh made up his mind, on the spur of the
moment, that it might be unwise for him to attempt
anything at once. He wanted a little
time to think things over, and lay out some
plan of campaign, for Hugh did not, as a
rule, believe in doing things hastily.</p>
<p>Besides, Benjy must have noticed him talking
with Tom, and would immediately jump to
the conclusion that it was a conspiracy between
them. The result would be disastrous for the
success of any future missionary work.</p>
<p>When Benjy came face to face with Hugh,
the latter spoke pleasantly. He noticed that
the boy colored up, and, although he answered
the friendly salutation, he immediately assumed
a reckless, indifferent air, and went
along whistling as though he had noticed their
heads together, and would snap his fingers at
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Hugh found himself wondering whether it
could be conscious guilt that made Benjy fire
up so, or simply boyish indignation over being
suspected and watched in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be some job managing that
boy,&rdquo; the scout master candidly admitted to
himself; but, then, somehow, he always found
additional interest in a task that tried his patience,
and his powers of endurance, for there
could be very little satisfaction in beating an
antagonist who was handicapped.</p>
<p>Hugh was unusually quiet on that evening
at the supper table, a fact his folks may have
noticed. But then they were accustomed to
seeing the boy look grave, for owing to the
position he held in the scouts, Hugh often had
to wrestle with matters that did not give most
of the other fellows a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p>Later on, Hugh, having gotten his lessons,
observed that he was going over to the home
of Professor Marvin, where there was to be
a little meeting of people interested in town
improvement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The smile that broke over the face of his
mother at hearing him say this so modestly
told of the pride she took in the fact that
Hugh, as the assistant scout master, should
be consulted at all when events of considerable
magnitude connected with uplift movements
were being discussed.</p>
<p>It certainly must make any mother&rsquo;s heart
beat with joy when realizing that her son,
though only a boy in years, had become a factor
in town, that he has to be consulted, and his
aid asked whenever there is a movement on
foot looking to bettering conditions of living
in the community.</p>
<p>When Hugh reached the house where Professor
Marvin lived, he found a little company
assembled. Besides a number of the leading
ladies identified with the league that had already
done so much for the betterment of the
town, there were three pastors present, the
mayor of Oakvale, Doctor Kane, always to
be relied on in things of this sort, and three
influential citizens, who like many other people
had begun to despair of any concerted
movement directed to change the wretched
conditions then prevailing.</p>
<p>There had been rambling talk going on.
Evidently they had been waiting for the arrival
of Mayor Strunk, whom Hugh had seen
pass in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Mr. Marvin now opened the meeting, which
he said would be an informal affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that every person in Oakvale
who has taken the trouble to pay any attention
to the way things are going,&rdquo; he began to say,
&ldquo;has been pained by the conditions prevailing.
It is the consensus of opinion that something
must be done, and that immediately, to better
things. The only question that has kept this
movement from crystallizing before has been
the lack of cohesion; no one seemed to be able
to present a proper plan that would unite all
the different organizations interested in the
good name of our town. And that is the object
of this meeting to-night. We must all get
together, and put our shoulders to the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Strunk, seeing that most eyes were
immediately directed toward his quarter, got
up to say his little piece. As usual, he was for
procrastination. He had attended several
other meetings during the winter just passed
and always advised going slowly, so as not to
make any mistake. The ladies had now become
indignant, and quite out of patience with
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>So when the suave politician commenced by
saying that he realized as well as any one the
need of something being done to improve living
in Oakvale, and then went on to repeat the
old advice not to be too hasty, because Rome
was not built in a day, and all that sort of
thing, there were quick glances passing
around, and one lady had to be held down by
main force, so eager was she to take the
speaker to task, regardless of parliamentary
rules.</p>
<p>Hardly had the mayor finished speaking,
than she was on her feet, with flashing eyes.
A ripple of applause greeted her taking the
floor, because those present understood how
fluently Mrs. Beverly could speak when her
heart was full of a subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mayor Strunk advises delay, and delay,&rdquo;
she broke out with, indignantly. &ldquo;I decline
to agree with his policy. I have heard it advocated
many times before, and nothing was
ever done. The time to strike is when the iron
is hot! Conditions are daily growing more
unbearable. To-day our fair town has fallen
from the position we once so proudly boasted.
There are hidden snares for the feet of our
young men and boys, about which the police
must know. They should be wiped out pitilessly.
There are numberless nuisances that
are painful to the eyes and noses of sensitive
people; these should be rigorously pursued
with fines and other penalties until they are
abated. If we have not laws on the books to
cover all these offences let us see to it that
they are immediately placed there. Then there
is another crying evil that should be stopped
without delay. I refer to several dangerous
crossings where accidents have been known to
happen, and at any day a terrible tragedy may
stun the community. Listen while I tell you
something that by the merest accident I witnessed
myself, and only a few hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in graphic language, she went on to
describe the affair at the crossing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those little children were anxious to get
home. They waited all of five minutes, and
there was not the first chance given them to
cross over, so stupid and selfish have the drivers
and chauffeurs in Oakvale become, because
the law is not strictly enforced. Then that one
little chit, Anita Burns, bravely started across,
eager to get to where an anxious mother
waited for her. I saw a team of horses towering
over her, and my heart literally stood
in my mouth with fear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>She had everybody intensely interested by
this time. Hugh drew back a little for he
feared she might mention him by name, and
he shrank from publicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in the nick of time I saw a boy dart
forward,&rdquo; continued the lady passionately.
&ldquo;He was lost to my sight for a brief period,
and then when I thought I should faint with
fear and suspense, I saw him appear on the
opposite walk, carrying the child, uninjured,
in his arms. He set her down on her feet,
waved his hand to her, and then walked off
with several of his scout chums, just as unconcerned,
apparently, as though it might be nothing
unusual; nor was it, my friends, for by this
time we have all become accustomed to hear
about&mdash;Hugh Hardin doing valiant things like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, because there was a wild outburst
of cheers.</p>
<p>Hugh was as red as fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I had known that you saw that little
happening, Mrs. Beverly, and meant to speak
of it here, I might not have come over, though
I certainly did want to hear what was said and
done,&rdquo; Hugh managed to stammer, at which
there was another round of cheers accompanied
by hand clapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the best part of it all, Hugh,&rdquo; said
the lady. &ldquo;The fellow who can do a clever
thing like that and still shrink from publicity,
doubly wins our admiration. But, my friends,
I only mentioned the incident to show you how
at any day there may take place a terrible
tragedy at one of these unprotected crossings,
where our innocent children have to pass over,
going to and coming home from school. Now
what shall we do about it? Must we wait until
a fatality comes about before we combine all
forces for good to crush these menaces to our
peace and happiness? I say to you the hour
has struck, and the women of this town are
at last determined to sweep every obstacle out
of their way in order to attain their end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Strunk threw up his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;I surrender, ladies!&rdquo; he hastened to exclaim,
with the air of a man who knew how
to get in out of the wet when it began raining.
&ldquo;Just as you say, the time for delay has passed,
and from this night forward you can count
on me as being with you, heart and soul. That
little girl, Anita Burns, is my own grandchild,
some of you may remember, and if anything
had happened to her could I ever forgive myself?
I guess it needed something like this to
take the scales from my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked happy when they heard
the mayor say this. Really, it had been his
system of procrastination that had kept matters
from reaching a climax long before. No
one professed to understand just why he should
have acted as he did, since his position as
mayor carried no salary with it.</p>
<p>Professor Marvin later on called upon
Hugh, as representing the scouts of Oakvale,
to outline the idea he had in mind of having
the boys made assistant police, with authority
to wear badges, and power to order arrests in
cases of emergency.</p>
<p>The mayor was somewhat dubious about the
propriety of so radical a proceeding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be almost revolutionary,&rdquo; he observed,
&ldquo;but then we happen to know how well
Hugh can be trusted to keep his troop under
strict control, and they have before this amply
proven worthy of the citizens&rsquo; full trust.
I shall call a meeting of the town council for
to-morrow night, and as many of you as can,
be present; I&rsquo;d be glad of your backing when
this scheme is thrashed out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So at last the uplift movement had come to
Oakvale, thanks in part to Hugh Hardin and
his fellow scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">WAITING FOR THE GOOD NEWS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;For home protection! That&rsquo;s the slogan,
fellows, Hugh has given us. We&rsquo;re going to
take our coats off, figuratively speaking, you
understand, and purify the atmosphere around
the place we live in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Billy Worth gave utterance to these
rather boastful remarks he was standing, with
a bunch of other fellows in khaki, near the
building where the town council, as called together
by the mayor, was still in session.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Undoubtedly the fathers of Oakvale were
having a warm discussion, since they had been
at it for more than two hours. Indeed, the
scouts had held their meeting in the room under
the church, and made all their arrangements
for carrying out their part of the programme,
if everything went smoothly as they
expected. A goodly number of the energetic
lads had immediately, after the meeting was
adjourned, decided to hurry around to ascertain
what had happened at the council chamber,
to which citizens were admitted to the
capacity of the room, but the line was drawn
at fellows under the voting age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack Durham immediately added,
with his characteristic energy, &ldquo;Oakvale is
going to take its periodical bath, so to speak.
This time we&rsquo;ll scrub to the bone, and make
an extra clean job of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impudent drivers and chauffeurs must
be made to respect the law, if fines and imprisonment
will do the trick!&rdquo; asserted Dick Ballamy,
who, for a wonder, seemed able to turn
his thoughts from fishing to a subject that
was of far more importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Not only that,&rdquo; Sam Winter burst
out impetuously, &ldquo;but those sneaking dives
known as &lsquo;speak-easies&rsquo; have got to be
squelched. Some people don&rsquo;t believe any
liquor is being sold in Oakvale just because
we&rsquo;re called a dry town. That fire the other
day proved the foolishness of that joke, let me
tell you, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it did!&rdquo; declared Mark Trowbridge,
who often lisped when he talked, an
infirmity that was likely to follow him through
life; &ldquo;why, I thaw with my own eyeth two barrelth
of bottleth half covered with a blanket,
that had been carried from the cobbler&rsquo;th
thop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, even,&rdquo; asserted Arthur
Cameron in disgust. &ldquo;I saw a man deliberately
lift the cover, take out a bottle, and drain
it there, with a dozen people standing around
and laughing. Shows you how some of our
laws are being made a joke. The police are
aware of what&rsquo;s going on, too; but they believe
the sentiment of the town has heretofore
been against enforcing certain statutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re going to get a rude shock
pretty soon, believe me,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Half an
hour ago the mayor and Council sent for Chief
Andy Wallis. He&rsquo;s in there with them now,
listening to the law being laid down. I reckon
the Chief knows by this time that it&rsquo;s going to
be a clean town or we get a new head of police.
The women have taken things in hand,
and mean to purify the atmosphere, so that
Oakvale boys and girls can breathe without
being contaminated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;How fast the news spread all over town
this morning,&rdquo; observed Walter Osborne, the
leader of the Hawk Patrol, a fine, manly looking
fellow well liked by all his associates of
the troop. &ldquo;Why, my mother says they were
talking of it in every store she visited, and father
added that he was buttonholed half a
dozen times by men who seemed chock full of
the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Doc Kane,&rdquo; added Sam Winter, &ldquo;carried
the news wherever he went. He said it
was going to be next door to a millennium for
Oakvale, and that when the movement had exhausted
its force he expected to have his business
reduced one-half, because of the improved
sanitary conditions that would prevail. That
was one of the Doc&rsquo;s little jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s loaded to the muzzle with ammunition
meant to boost the good cause along,&rdquo; asserted
another scout. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s among the mill
people the good doctor does most of his missionary
work. He knows how much a clean
town means to fellows who haven&rsquo;t comfortable
homes to spend evenings in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s no danger that the members
of the town Council will try to dodge the
question again, as they&rsquo;ve done so many
times?&rdquo; Jack Durham was saying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Billy gave a scoffing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much they will!&rdquo; he ejaculated; &ldquo;with
that wide-awake Mrs. Marsh present, backed
by a lady who can strike out from the shoulder
like Mrs. Beverly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Walter, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget what
Hugh told us about the sudden change of front
on the part of Mayor Strunk. He saw a great
light when he learned how his favorite little
granddaughter had come near being run over
by a team at that dangerous crossing of the
three roads in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s another thing that&rsquo;s bound to
cut some figure in the decision of the town
Council to-night,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Public sentiment
has been aroused, and is at white heat.
It seems as if everything combined to happen
all at once, for this very afternoon old Mr.
Merkle was knocked down by a speeding car
that got away without anybody learning its
number. He was badly hurt, and they took
him to the hospital; but we&rsquo;ve been told that
the brave old chap, nearly eighty-five years of
age, has sent a message of cheer to the ladies
from his bed, telling them that he glories in
being a martyr to the good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Every fellow take off his hat to old Mr.
Merkle, for he&rsquo;s made of the stuff our Revolutionary
fathers had in them when this country
dared defy Great Britain,&rdquo; and as Walter
Osborne said this, each scout raised his campaign
hat with a touch of respect for the grand
old hero lying on his bed of pain, yet able to
think of the reform movement that was sweeping
through the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Hugh now!&rdquo; called out a fellow
on the outskirts of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he looks as if he felt satisfied with the
way things were going,&rdquo; another hastened to
say.</p>
<p>The young assistant scout master quickly
joined them. He was besieged by numerous
questions. Indeed, so thick and fast did these
come that Hugh laughed and threw up his
hands, as though to shield himself from a fall
of hailstones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up, fellows,&rdquo; he told them; &ldquo;what
do you take me for? When you send them
at me like that it makes me feel as the street
urchin did who crawled into an empty sugar
hogshead, and, seeing the riches around him,
wished for a thousand tongues. Give me a
fair chance and I&rsquo;ll tell what little I&rsquo;ve been
able to pick up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Accordingly they quieted down, though still
pressing around Hugh, and hanging on his
every word. Confidence in their leader is one
of the highest attributes of praise scouts can
show; and the members of Oakvale Troop felt
this to the limit in the boy who had been elected
to serve them in that capacity. So often had
Hugh Hardin proved his ability to fill his exalted
position that no one ever dreamed nowadays
of contesting the leadership with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed to interview Zack Huffman,&rdquo;
explained Hugh, &ldquo;who had been inside, but
had to go home to his family because his wife
is sick. He could stop only a minute or so
to talk, but he told me the sentiment was overwhelmingly
in favor of carrying out the whole
sweeping programme. The ladies have got in
the saddle, so he said, and mean to ride at the
head of the procession. You remember Zack
is something of a scholar, and you ought to
have heard him tell how they expect to beat
the record of Hercules in cleaning the Augean
stables.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Zack!&rdquo; cried one enthusiastic
scout, for the boys were by this time so roused
up over matters that they felt in the mood to
cheer anybody and anything that favored their
cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every now and then,&rdquo; continued Hugh, &ldquo;I
could hear applause from above there. I&rsquo;ve
got an idea Mrs. Beverly was talking. If she
was, you can wager not a single member of the
Council will dare vote against the mayor&rsquo;s programme
after it&rsquo;s been announced. It&rsquo;s going
to be carried with a whirl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is, we ought to burn a few barrels to
celebrate to-night!&rdquo; suggested Sam Winter,
for such a programme always pleased him immensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Hugh instantly told him. &ldquo;We
want none of that sort of thing to-night. For
once let&rsquo;s show that boys can be dignified. This
is no Fourth of July affair. Some of the
church people have even contemplated holding
prayer meetings after the Council adjourns, if
everything seems favorable, for their hearts
are right in this uplift movement. It wouldn&rsquo;t
seem just the right thing for scouts to be seen
running like wild Indians all over town, and
shouting their lungs out. We&rsquo;ll just go home
in a quiet way, and get ready to commence
business on Monday. Time enough for a jubilee
when the ladies appoint a day for celebrating
the victory. Just now we&rsquo;ve got work,
and plenty of it, ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; asserted Arthur Cameron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget that I said it, Hugh!&rdquo; begged the
impulsive Sam, abashed by the argument advanced
by the scout master, because his better
sense told him that was the proper way of
looking at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there comes Chief Wallis out of the
Council chamber!&rdquo; called a voice, and immediately
every fellow turned his eyes in that direction,
anxious to decide for himself what
the appearance of the head of the police force
would indicate.</p>
<p>Chief Wallis walked straight toward them.
His face was inscrutable, but as he reached
the group of scouts, with Hugh at their head,
he thrilled the boys by raising a hand in salute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and see me on Monday, Hugh,&rdquo;
the Chief said, dramatically, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll fix it
up about what sort of badge you and your
fellow Assistant Police can wear. The women
have carried the day, and Oakvale is going to
be purged,&rdquo; and as he strode on the boys broke
into a series of stirring cheers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">OAKVALE&rsquo;S GREAT CLEAN-UP DAY.</span></h2>
<p>According to the universal agreement, every
pastor in Oakvale made some mention in his
sermon on the following Sunday of the new
movement that had been inaugurated by the
better elements in the town. They urged every
one of their flocks who wanted to see a cleaner
Oakvale, morally and actually, to back up the
committee.</p>
<p>It was the talk of the day wherever two or
more persons came together, and there were
places where the action of the town Council
was either severely criticized or else condemned.
No one need be told that as a rule
these were the dens of vice that had been
insulting the law and flaunting their brazen
defiance in the teeth of the citizens.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to be waiting with pent-up
breath to see whether things would begin to
move immediately Monday opened up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>By noon on Monday posters began to appear
all over town, signed by the mayor, stating
in concise, legal phrases how from that
hour forward the law was going to be strictly
enforced to the letter, and telling all about the
plan to enlist the active co-operation of the Boy
Scouts in helping to make a clean town.</p>
<p>After school that afternoon the fellows belonging
to Oakvale Troop to the number of
thirty marched to police headquarters. That
three of the boys did not respond to roll call
before marching through the streets, Hugh ascertained,
was because in two instances they
were sick at home with a mild attack of grippe,
while the third boy was evidently kept away
because he had an uncle who was believed to
be the worst offender on the list, so that his
folks were hardly in favor of appearing to go
against their own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>But the boys, as they marched the full length
of the main street, were cheered by shoppers
and shopkeepers and clerks, as well as others
who crowded to the doors and windows. For
it was well known what part Hugh and his
fellow scouts were going to take in the redemption
of Oakvale. Their previous success in
ridding the town of cluttering rubbish gave
people confidence in their ability to do even
greater things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The Chief had his men lined up in front of
the headquarters. He believed in doing things
according to rule, and meant to receive the
scouts as fellow workers in the good cause.</p>
<p>To hear the speech Chief Wallis made the
new Assistant Police any one would have believed
his heart had always been in the laudable
enterprise of trying to clean up the dives,
and protect the dangerous crossings. Perhaps
it had, but the Chief being a politician dared
not show his hand so long as he felt that public
sentiment was against any change of policy.
He knew better now. He had heard the ringing
words that fell from Mrs. Beverly&rsquo;s lips,
which speech, according to all accounts, eclipsed
any oration ever delivered in the town hall; the
Chief was fully enlisted in the cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will have official badges made without
delay for each and every member of the Assistant
Police,&rdquo; he told the listening boys, who
interrupted his speech with frequent cheers.
&ldquo;In the meanwhile, as the posters issued by
His Honor the Mayor state, your regular
scout emblem will be badge enough, and must
be respected everywhere within the limits of
this town. Possibly some people will at first
be inclined to treat your show of authority as
a joke, and laugh at any orders you may issue.
After a few of them have been arrested by my
regular officers, and either fined or placed in
jail for some days, they will have their eyes
opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Chief went on to explain just what
their line of work would consist of, and where
they must draw the line. Certain duties they
could proceed to carry out, but the regular officers
would be used to make most arrests, especially
where there was any danger involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;it is not
intended that the boys operating with this
movement are going to become spies, to find
out what their neighbors may be doing, but we
expect you to keep your eyes open to discover
any glaring infraction of the laws, as mentioned
in that poster, and your leader will
thereupon report any such discovery at headquarters,
from where it will be attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>He then earnestly besought them to be on
their dignity, and guard against any unnecessary
show of being conceited, or too proud of
their new positions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go about your work without any display
of authority. People will begin by sneering at
you, but if you do your duty faithfully they
will soon come to respect your badge. Never
forget that the best people of the community
are behind you in all you may attempt. Hugh,
we look to you to be a safe guide for your followers,
and the mayor told me to inform you
that he expects every scout to do his part manfully.
That&rsquo;s about all I have to say to you
to-day, though from time to time I expect to
confer with your leader, and lay out new plans.
I salute you all again as members in full standing
of the Police Force of Oakvale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh had his plans pretty well laid out,
though everything could not be accomplished
at once. He had selected certain members of
the troop for duty at the dangerous crossings,
beginning on the very next morning. In doing
this, Hugh had used much discretion, for he
expected that there would be more or less
trouble, since drivers and chauffeurs had become
so accustomed to having their own way
that they would object strenuously to any interference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>It turned out, however, that Chief Wallis
foresaw this very source of trouble, and had
delegated several officers to stand near by in
readiness to arrest the first driver who failed
to pull up when a scout raised his white-gloved
hand as an order for him to do so.</p>
<p>That was a pretty warm day in sections at
police headquarters. Arrests came in quick
succession, as though a regular scheme had
been arranged to make the new order a laughing-stock.
But the mayor had a magistrate
ready, and those who were brought in charged
with breaking the traffic rules, as well as in
some cases resisting an officer had heavy fines
imposed upon them, with the alternative of
several days in the lockup if they refused to
settle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>It was astonishing how quickly the news
went around that the mayor actually meant to
stand by the ladies and the scouts in the crusade.
For the first time that evening in many
moons, every questionable and shady resort
about Oakvale was closed as tight as a drum,
as Billy Worth explained it, after a walk about
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he told Hugh, with glistening eyes,
&ldquo;you can see the fellows who used to spend
most of their time in those places standing on
the street corners watching to see what next
is going to happen. They look dazed and
glum, I tell you; yes, and ugly, too, because
their business is going to be all busted up.
They&rsquo;re telling each other that the way things
are starting in it looks like more than just a
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A new broom sweeps clean!&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
Hugh. &ldquo;I never doubted but what once the
people of this town woke up it could be done,
and in a hurry. The only question is how long
will it last? A whole lot of persons will soon
get tired of the novelty, and public sentiment
may swing around to indifference again. That
is what we have to fear more than anything
else. Those bad men will just wait for things
to take a change, and as scouts we&rsquo;ve got to
see to it that the enthusiasm never dies out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>After an exciting day, Hugh felt pretty tired
that Monday evening. He had received special
reports from all the scouts who had been on
duty. These covered a multitude of things
from difficulties at the crossings when traffic
was held up at such times as the smaller children
were going to and from school, to infractions
of the laws of cleanliness and health
persisted in by certain citizens who ought to
have known better.</p>
<p>Hugh carefully read every one of these reports,
and they were numerous, for the boys
had been extremely vigilant, as if to prove
their right to be called Auxiliary Police. Hugh
used his own discretion about keeping some of
these reports. A few he smiled at, and made
a mental note to warn the writer that it was
not intended to enter into private property in
order to spy around, but that the complaints
must be of such things as offended the public
eye or ear or nose; after which he tore these up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The others he carefully filed with a good
deal of satisfaction, to be later on submitted to
Chief Wallis, after copies had been taken for
the scout records. On the whole, Hugh believed
the boys had made good that day, despite
all the novelty of the thing, and the
troubles they had met with. As time passed
on and people came more and more to recognize
them as a part of the regular system for
carrying out the laws that were upon the
books, much of this friction would die away,
and the wheels of machinery could be expected
to move more smoothly.</p>
<p>Hugh, feeling that he must not neglect his
studies on account of this outside occupation,
had just taken out his books, and was about to
settle down to an hour or so of &ldquo;grind,&rdquo; when
he heard the doorbell ring.</p>
<p>Then he caught a familiar voice asking if he
were at home. It was Tom Sherwood, stationed
that day at the most dangerous crossing
in all Oakvale, and who Hugh understood,
from all accounts, had acquitted himself splendidly.</p>
<p>The sound of Tom&rsquo;s voice suddenly recalled
to Hugh&rsquo;s mind the fact that he had promised
to help the other. It had been utterly impossible
for Hugh to attempt anything along the
lines he had suggested, concerning an interview
with Benjy Sherwood, for his day had
been crammed full of duties, great and small.</p>
<p>But when Tom burst into his room impetuously
Hugh could see from his face that the
other had more bad news to communicate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE PROMISE OF A SCOUT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Tom! Glad to have you drop around
to see me!&rdquo; was the friendly and cheery salute
of the scout master, as he nodded to the
newcomer.</p>
<p>Boys do not usually wait on ceremony when
visiting, so Tom, without bothering to be asked
to take a seat, dropped into an easy-chair.</p>
<p>Like most fellows of his age, Hugh had his
room fitted up in as cozy a fashion as suited
his fancy. There were the customary college
flags decorating the walls, and some well-selected
pictures that showed the bent of Hugh&rsquo;s
mind toward art, a small matter, perhaps, in
the opinion of most people, but of moment with
any one really desirous of knowing the nature
of the boy who lives and sleeps inside those
walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>One thing Hugh had noticed particularly.
This was the exceeding great care his guest
took in making sure that he had properly
closed the door after him when entering the
room. As a rule, Tom was inclined to be more
or less careless in this respect, being a breezy
sort of a chap. Hugh guessed that there might
be a reason for this unusual caution, and it so
proved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, it&rsquo;s getting worse all the time!&rdquo; was
the first remark the newcomer made, and in
a low voice, at that, as if he did not by any
chance want to be overheard by others in the
adjoining room.</p>
<p>Hugh could easily guess what those depressing
words meant. If he had entertained any
sort of doubt, the sigh that followed would
have dispelled them. Tom was in deeper
trouble than ever, and that active younger
brother of his, Benjy, was undoubtedly the
cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Benjy been doing now, Tom?&rdquo; he
asked, in as soothing a voice as he could summon
to his aid.</p>
<p>Tom scratched his head, as though a trifle
puzzled to know just how to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Hugh, I don&rsquo;t know
what he is after, but he&rsquo;s doing some mighty
queer stunts. I never knew him to try to steal
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, that&rsquo;s a pretty hard word to use,
Tom!&rdquo; remonstrated the scout master, trying
to appear unbelieving, although he had felt a
little chill on hearing Tom say what he did.</p>
<p>Poor Tom shook his head as if very downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much it knocks me to
even suspect such a thing, Hugh,&rdquo; he presently
managed to say, and there was a plain tremor
to his voice, usually so robust and strong. &ldquo;In
spite of his headstrong ways, Benjy has always
been such a lovable fellow that&mdash;well,
I&rsquo;d go through fire and water for him if I could
do him any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would,&rdquo; ventured Hugh, consolingly,
as the other boy stopped, to gulp several
times, as though nearly choking with emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since he started going with the set
that trains with the newcomer in Oakvale,
Park Norris,&rdquo; commenced Tom, &ldquo;Benjy seems
to have changed ever so much, and all for the
worse. It worries me heaps, and I don&rsquo;t know
how I&rsquo;m to get him back again. He seems
to listen, with a curl to his lip, whenever I
speak about it, and I&rsquo;m sure I try to act the big
brother to him, with my arm about his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s happened since I saw you
last, Tom,&rdquo; urged the scout master, desirous
of getting at the &ldquo;meat in the cocoanut&rdquo; as
quickly as possible, for he had an hour or so
to put in at studying, and, besides, was pretty
tired after a strenuous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Hugh. That was what brought me
here to see you. When we talked matters
over before, you promised to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat that promise, Tom. As the temporary
head of the troop, I could do no less;
and as your old chum I&rsquo;d go far out of my
way to give a helping hand to Tom Sherwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other heaved a sigh, and his eyes glistened
with a sudden moisture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Hugh,&rdquo; he managed to say,
half steadily. &ldquo;I knew I could depend on you.
I wanted to keep these things from our mother
as long as I could. She doesn&rsquo;t suspect anything
like the truth, for I heard her say only
the other day when Benjy had been rather irritable
that she feared he must be unwell, and
perhaps she ought to have Doctor Kane drop
in to look him over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a little truth in that, Tom,
don&rsquo;t you know!&rdquo; suggested Hugh, but the
other boy shook his head ominously in the
negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to believe it, Hugh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
would be only a matter of a dose of calomel or
some other medicine that old Doc Kane likes
to give, and my brother would be himself again.
But there&rsquo;s something more than that the matter.
However, I said I&rsquo;d start in and tell what
happened, and so here goes, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please get to the facts as soon as you can,
Tom,&rdquo; requested the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened this very afternoon,&rdquo; began
Tom. &ldquo;I came home, and started up to my
room to get something or other, when in the
glass at the end of the hall I happened to see
something move through the open door. You
know, Hugh, I have a little room all my own
at our house, and Benjy&rsquo;s is at the other end
of the hall. When I saw that it was my
brother in my room I was surprised, for of
late he hasn&rsquo;t bothered dropping in to visit
with me like he used to be so fond of doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to make a long story short, Hugh,
something tempted me to move softly along the
hall and look in past the partly open door.
Hugh, would you believe me, I was shocked
to see Benjy, whom I once believed the soul of
honor, actually rummaging in my trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you keep your trunk locked?&rdquo; asked
Hugh quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as a rule,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;unless I happen
to have something in it I don&rsquo;t want a servant
to see, or some Christmas presents I&rsquo;ve hid
away. I guess it wasn&rsquo;t locked to-day, in fact,
I know it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; said the scout
master, really relieved. &ldquo;Younger brothers
often think they have a right to rummage
when the notion strikes them, I understand.
Why should you think it so strange, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt so badly about
it some time ago,&rdquo; admitted Tom; &ldquo;but so
many suspicious things have happened, you
see, to make me think Benjy is going along the
fast road. There was his taking that money
from his savings bank, and answering me so
impudently when I asked him what he was
spending it for, instead of waiting till the
Fourth of July. Hugh, I keep my own savings
bank lying in my trunk, along with a lot
of other stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he meant to open that, and
extract some of the contents?&rdquo; asked Hugh,
feeling uncomfortably chilly at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to say what terrible thoughts
chased through my brain when I saw him turning
things upside down as though he couldn&rsquo;t
find what he was looking for,&rdquo; the grieved Tom
went on to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; inquired Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I thought of doing was to
step right in and ask him what he meant by
getting in my trunk while I was away. But
somehow, Hugh, I just couldn&rsquo;t bring myself
to do that, so I slipped down to the head of the
stairs, and then started to whistle, and make a
noise with my feet, as if I might be coming up
from the lower floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh, greatly interested, as
Tom paused to gulp again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I stepped into my room, Benjy had
managed to get the trunk closed, for I had
heard the lid bang down. He was going
around looking up at the walls in the most innocent
way possible, and as soon as I came in
he asked me if I would mind lending him my
old tennis racquet for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps he wanted to have a game
with some of the fellows over on the courts,&rdquo;
explained Hugh. &ldquo;I noticed that several sets
were on this afternoon for the first time this
season. You were always a crackerjack at tennis,
Tom, and it may run in the blood with all
the Sherwoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where the trouble comes in,
Hugh. Benjy never cared a red cent for playing,
though I often wanted him to take a hand.
No, I&rsquo;m afraid that was just a sudden idea that
flashed into his head, so that I wouldn&rsquo;t think
it strange that I should find him prowling in
my room. Besides, he was as red as a beet
when he asked me that simple question, and
mother would never have thought he looked
pale and sick if she had only seen him <i>then</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say anything to him, of course,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean accuse him in any way, Hugh,
certainly not,&rdquo; came the ready answer. &ldquo;To
tell you the truth, my heart was just too full
and too sore to think of scolding, or anything
like that. I stepped over to where my old
racquet stood behind the door, for I meant to
have it restrung this spring, as it was getting
in poor shape at the close of last season; and I
handed it to Benjy, trying to look natural, too.
I&rsquo;m afraid, though, he must have seen something
queer in my face, for I noticed he gave
me a quick stare just as he took the racquet
and hurried off, with muttered thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh pondered over the matter. He hardly
knew what to say. It might be a very innocent
thing, on the part of Benjy. Again, there
was a chance that the worst Tom feared might
be only too true.</p>
<p>Hugh did not like the new boy in town, Park
Norris. He had too much spending money
for his own good, and it was said that his influence
was not of the best upon several fellows
who seemed to be fascinated by his manner
and ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Tom,&rdquo; the scout master
presently remarked seriously, &ldquo;leave this matter
with me, and I promise you I&rsquo;ll take it up
very soon. I&rsquo;ll try and learn how much Benjy
is under the influence of Park Norris, and
then find out if I can&rsquo;t win his confidence. I
seem to have a pretty good knack that way; at
least, fellows tell me so, and I glory in it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure that if only you could get
Benjy to promise to break off with the set he&rsquo;s
been running with, Hugh, it would come out
all right. It&rsquo;s the cigarette and card habit
I&rsquo;m most afraid of. He&rsquo;s such a lovable boy,
you know, and I guess he is more easily led
than I. So Park Norris has managed to get
a grip on him. I don&rsquo;t know of a single fellow
who could win him back to his old way of living
as well as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my promise, Tom, remember,
and I think I have the reputation of always
keeping my word. I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to
make Benjy see that he&rsquo;s on the wrong track.
Will that satisfy you, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom suddenly clutched his friend&rsquo;s hand
and squeezed it convulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Hugh, thank you ever so
much!&rdquo; he went on to say, trying to restrain
his emotion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got such confidence in your
way of doing things that somehow I seem to
believe it&rsquo;s just bound to come out all right,
now that you&rsquo;re going to go up against the evil
influence of that Park Norris. Benjy will give
in if he&rsquo;s approached in the right spirit, and
nobody knows how better to do that than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and keep on feeling that way, Tom,&rdquo;
advised the other, as his visitor picked up his
hat preparatory to leaving. &ldquo;Above all things
don&rsquo;t let Benjy see that you suspect him. Be
particularly kind to him. Every time you do
things for him it&rsquo;s going to be a fresh stab at
his conscience, you know. In the end it&rsquo;ll
make my job the easier. That&rsquo;s all there is
to do. Leave the rest to me, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the look of brimming gratitude which
Tom Sherwood gave his chum spoke more eloquently
than any words he could have uttered
would have done. When he went forth again
into the night air his brain was calmed by the
thought that Hugh had again promised to help
him; and past experiences and observation told
Tom that the young scout master nearly always
did everything he attempted.</p>
<p>Hugh, on his part, had hard work keeping
his mind on his studies the rest of the evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">HOW THE &ldquo;UPLIFT&rdquo; WORKED.</span></h2>
<p>As the days went by, every one became convinced
that a great change, and for the better,
had come upon Oakvale. The scouts had entered
upon their share in the uplift with boyish
enthusiasm. They had already, most of
them, seen service along somewhat similar
lines, and felt as though they were veterans.
Besides, they were constantly encouraged by
the kind words and praise of the women whose
weighty influence was back of the movement
to encourage everything that was for the betterment
of conditions in and around Oakvale,
so as to make it a model town for clean living.</p>
<p>There were mistakes, plenty of them, but
the scouts learned from experience, and it
might be noticed that the same fellow seldom
if ever committed the same blunder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>As the days went by, they became more
and more proficient in their tasks, earning
hearty praise from all those who were so
deeply interested in the work. After a few
drivers and chauffeurs had been fined, and
some of them locked up for a spell, they began
to realize that the scouts were not to be reckoned
with as a big joke. When a boy, in the
now respected khaki, standing in the middle of
the street at that dangerous crossing, held up
his white-gloved hand, traffic came to a sudden
stop, and there was safe passage across for
the groups of small children on the way to
and from school.</p>
<p>It only delayed things for a minute at the
most, but precious young lives were rendered
safe from accident. Those boys who were
given this privilege in regular rotation showed
by their manner that they felt proud to fulfill
their duties; nor did they in any instance abuse
the privilege their badges gave them above
their fellows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>What had at first seemed like a lark in the
eyes of other boys not members of the troop
presently became a serious matter. When
some of them started to annoy members of the
new Auxiliary Police they were soon startled
by a visit at their homes by the stern Chief
himself, who warned their folks that a second
offense would mean severe punishment. Possibly
some of those parents took it upon themselves
to start operations by selecting a nice
stout switch and keeping it in view.</p>
<p>However, gradually order came out of
chaos. Hugh worked faithfully trying to remedy
whatever proved to be faulty, and, of
course, there were numberless things that constantly
required attention.</p>
<p>Those were busy days for the regular police,
and it kept them on the go, warning offenders
against the sanitary code that affairs
must be speedily altered; for those wide-awake
eyes of the thirty scouts on duty all the time
seemed to discover a myriad of things that
were not being conducted according to law,
and were a disgrace to any decent community.</p>
<p>The mayor was now heart and soul in the
work. He realized that he had the backing of
the solid people of the town, as well as all the
church members, and the women besides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Once Oakvale had experienced the delight
of being really clean it would require an upheaval
to make them change back to old conditions.
There was an element, however, as
is always the case in every community, that
looked upon these happenings with more or
less angry mutterings and frowns, for with
the change had passed their source of gain and
livelihood. They knew better than to talk
openly against the new order of things, but
whenever and wherever the opportunity arose
they would try to excite derision for the &ldquo;uplift&rdquo;
movement.</p>
<p>It seemed as though these people who loved
darkness rather than light felt especially sore
toward Hugh Hardin and his scouts. They
believed that somehow the khaki boys were
the backbone of the whole business, as they
were the ones whose eyes detected offenses and
reported the same to headquarters every day.
With a score and a half of bright lads constantly
on the scent it was difficult for anything
unlawful to escape notice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Without the help given by Hugh and his
scouts the movement could never have attained
such wonderful success from the beginning&mdash;that
was as good as acknowledged by almost
every one on both sides. It was not singular
then that some of the lower elements, finding
themselves hedged about with so many difficulties
in gaining a livelihood in such a spick-and-span
town, should get their heads together
with the object of devising some shrewd
method by means of which the old conditions
might be brought back again.</p>
<p>Plainly then to do this the easiest way
would be to conjure up some means whereby
the new order of things would be brought into
contempt. Hugh himself had more than once
been given obscure threats that unless he relaxed
his vigilance and shut his eyes to certain
things if they started up again, he would find
himself in a peck of trouble.</p>
<p>Not once did the boy flinch, even though he
felt that some of these men were of a desperate
nature, and would descend to almost
any mean depths when their former lawless
habits were interfered with. Hugh consulted
with the minister, Mr. Dobbs, and the mayor
of Oakvale, both of whom promised to stand
by the scouts through any difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>These things aroused the women greatly
when they heard of them. Plainly the enemies
of the community were becoming alarmed,
thinking they had been cast out for good. If
conditions did not soon improve there would
have to be considerable emigration to other
communities that did not have ambitions to
merit the name of &ldquo;Spotless Town.&rdquo; But it
was believed that before they yielded up the
fight these people would very likely make one
last great effort to turn the tables on the reformers.</p>
<p>They had been engaging legal talent in Oakvale
to look up the law and ascertain whether
the mayor had not overstepped his authority
when he ordered certain resorts closed where
young fellows had been in the habit of congregating
to play pool. Although no actual proof
had as yet been produced, it was widely understood
that other games far less innocent had
also been played there, and that indeed liquor
could be procured on the premises by those
who &ldquo;knew the ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were other lawyers on the side of
the mayor, backed by the women and the reform
element. They made certain that things
were kept within the bounds granted by the
law. Then the town Council, now wholly committed
to the new order of things, announced
themselves ready to pass any additional law
necessary to continue things as they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>A week later and Hugh began to breathe
easier. He felt that matters had advanced so
far that they could plume themselves on making
the movement a success. He was every
day hoping to hear that the elements they had
cause to fear were commencing to leave town.
As long as they continued to abide in Oakvale
the danger was that of a snake &ldquo;scotched, not
killed,&rdquo; and liable to come to life again at any
time.</p>
<p>All this while he had not found a good
chance to keep his promise to Tom Sherwood,
mostly on account of the press of business.
With so many things depending on him while
acting in the place of Lieutenant Denmead,
still absent from home, as well as his studying
for the spring examinations, Hugh certainly
had his hands full.</p>
<p>But whenever he happened to meet Tom,
and saw that look of entreaty on the other&rsquo;s
face, Hugh took himself to task for not finding
time to enter upon the little side campaign for
the redemption of Benjy Sherwood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>So far as he knew, the latter did not seem
to be in the company of the Norris boy on the
various occasions when Hugh had noticed the
latter on the street. That was no reason, however,
that Benjy did not seek his society at
other times, and perhaps visit at Park&rsquo;s house,
where possibly cards were not prohibited as a
source of boyish amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start something doing in that
direction by to-morrow,&rdquo; Hugh was telling
himself as he walked toward home one afternoon,
after making a report to the Chief and
receiving the usual congratulations on his proficiency.</p>
<p>It was the sight of Benjy across the way
that caused him to say that, for the other had
come out of the store where all sorts of games,
from baseball goods and skates down to playing
cards, were for sale and exhibited in the
windows.</p>
<p>It seemed to Hugh, although he admitted
that perhaps his imagination made him think
so, that Benjy Sherwood glanced to the right
and left as he came out, as a fellow might who
was trying to hide something, or else felt conscience
stricken. He noticed that the other
was also trying to keep a package he carried
close to his body as he walked on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Suddenly Hugh saw Benjy turn and hurry
down a side street, almost running, in fact.
He hardly knew what to make of this until,
chancing to look further along, he discovered
Tom Sherwood in sight. It hardly seemed
likely that the other had noticed his younger
brother&rsquo;s very suspicious action in wanting to
elude him.</p>
<p>Hugh felt a strange fascination in connection
with the matter. It was growing more
interesting than ever, and more mysterious,
he admitted. What had Benjy been doing in
that store that he should dislike to have his
brother see him, and actually turn and slink
away?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know something about this before a
great while,&rdquo; Hugh was telling himself as he
walked slowly on, trying to figure out what
his best plan of campaign might be under the
circumstances. As a wise scout he always
tried to make ample preparations before starting
in on a game.</p>
<p>As once before, Hugh had gotten almost
within sight of his home fence when he heard
his name called from the rear. It was not
Tom Sherwood this time who came running
after him, but Ralph Kenyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Ralph had always been a great favorite of
Hugh&rsquo;s. There was a time when the other had
been making money trapping small fur-bearing
animals up above Oakvale, and proving
himself quite a woodsman, in so far as having
a knowledge of the habits of these four-footed
forest denizens went.</p>
<p>That was before Ralph became interested
in the scouts and finally joined the troop. He
could not be induced to set a single cruel steel
trap now, because he looked at things in an
entirely different light from those other days.
But he was without a peer in the whole troop
when it came to a question of following a trail,
or being able to understand what the thousand-and-one
little signs in the woods stood for.</p>
<p>Ralph looked excited, Hugh saw, as the
other drew near, and the first thing the scout
master thought the cause to be some fresh insult
from the rough element in town opposed
to the new conditions.</p>
<p>Hugh was ready to turn right-about face
and go back to the office of the Chief, if
Ralph&rsquo;s complaint seemed serious enough to
warrant it. He was determined that the work
so well begun should not be put back by any
underhand methods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Ralph soon came up, gulping in big draughts
of air. His face was red, and what seemed to
be a look of indignation, according to Hugh&rsquo;s
mind, could be seen there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something got twisted and needs straightening
out, eh, Ralph?&rdquo; asked the scout master
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that, I&rsquo;m afraid, Hugh,&rdquo; replied
Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the boys hurt, I hope?&rdquo; quickly
inquired Hugh, for the one thing he had been
dreading was an open rupture between the
rival forces in town, with stones flying and a
near-riot in the process of forming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not yet, Hugh, but if things keep on
there&rsquo;s going to be the dickens to pay,&rdquo; panted
Ralph, leaning against the fence as he spoke.
&ldquo;Fact is, those gamblers and law breakers have
got desperate, and they&rsquo;ve schemed to put us
scouts in a bad hole, so the mayor will have
to discharge us and start the whole uplift game
tumbling in the soup; that&rsquo;s what makes me
look so scared like, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">ONE USE FOR WOODCRAFT KNOWLEDGE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by putting us scouts in
a bad hole, Ralph?&rdquo; asked Hugh, quickly, for
what the other boy had said startled him.</p>
<p>Ralph glanced hurriedly about, as though to
make absolutely certain that no eavesdroppers
were near by to overhear what he said. Then
he drew closer to Hugh and assumed a most
mysterious manner that could not help having
an effect upon the surprised scout chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re as mad as hops, let me tell you,
Hugh,&rdquo; Ralph commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you mean, Ralph, those fellows
who were hurt when we put the lid tight on
Oakvale, and stopped their sneaky business,
whatever it may have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got together and mean to
fight back, that&rsquo;s how it stands now, Hugh,&rdquo;
he was told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;We knew they had employed lawyers and
were meaning to do everything they could to
get the mayor&rsquo;s acts called unconstitutional,&rdquo;
Hugh remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ve made up their minds, I guess,&rdquo;
Ralph continued hastily, &ldquo;that when it comes
to a show-down of law they haven&rsquo;t got a
chance to win out. Hugh, let me tell you again
some of that bunch are the most desperate
men going. Why, nobody would ever have believed
we had such monsters here in little old
Oakvale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! you&rsquo;re going pretty strong when
you use a word like that, Ralph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They deserve it every time, I tell you,&rdquo;
persisted the other. &ldquo;What else would you
call men who even scheme to have a store in
this town robbed, and then fix it so that marked
bills or pieces of jewelry will be found in the
pockets of certain scouts, you among the number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh stared hard at Ralph as though he
could hardly believe his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been dreaming that, have you,
Ralph?&rdquo; he finally asked, as he took hold of
the other&rsquo;s sleeve and drew him around so that
he could look straight into Ralph&rsquo;s eyes, which,
however, did not waver before his gaze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I haven&rsquo;t, Hugh,&rdquo; he was told
like a flash. &ldquo;I give you my word of honor I
heard that very scheme spoken of by three of
the leading spirits in this fight against a clean
town&mdash;Gaffney, who used to run that poolroom;
Slimmons, the retired boxer, who used
to be athletic trainer at the schools before
somehow he took to drinking so heavy they
had to drop him (and he&rsquo;s hung around Gaffney&rsquo;s
place ever since trying to pick up some
sort of living giving boxing lessons, etc.).
There was a third man present, but he doesn&rsquo;t
really live in town. I suspect he&rsquo;s been interested
on the quiet in dodging the law here by
supplying shady resorts with booze, and is
losing money as long as they stay shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did all this take place, tell me,
Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen then, Hugh. I happened to be coming
across lots down at the bowling alley corner
when I saw those three men dodge into
the place. You know it&rsquo;s been closed to play
ever since they found things were going on
there that had no business in Oakvale. Well,
I thought there was something queer about
the way those three men acted before they
dodged in, and my old sense of investigation
at once began to urge me to take a peek and
see what they might be up to. If any sort of
game was going on, the police ought to know,
you understand, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you were acting within your
rights as a member of the regular police force,
in figuring on doing so,&rdquo; the other assured
him.</p>
<p>Ralph smiled grimly as though pleased to receive
that reassurance from the one in whom
he placed unlimited confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was as easy as falling off a log for
me to discover a window that I could crawl
through,&rdquo; Ralph went on to say, &ldquo;and nobody
saw me do it either. I haven&rsquo;t been watching
mink, otter, and foxes pull off their sly tricks
without learning a thing or two. So once I
got inside the old building it wasn&rsquo;t much of a
job to find where they were sitting, jabbering
away like everything, in low voices, as if they
didn&rsquo;t want to be heard outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I couldn&rsquo;t begin to repeat what I
heard. All of them were excited, and in dead
earnest, too. Each one had suggestions to
make that sometimes made my blood run cold.
Their well-paying business has been closed up,
you see, and that&rsquo;s what makes them so bent
on striking a blow to end this silly &lsquo;racket,&rsquo; as
they contemptuously call the uplift movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Hugh, just as I said in the beginning,
they&rsquo;re actually planning to have a robbery
committed, and manage it so that some of the
stuff that&rsquo;s taken will be found on a number
of the scouts. Just how this is to be done they
hadn&rsquo;t fully settled; but it&rsquo;s all going to be
fixed this very night, so that before another
forty-eight hours have passed the dirty game
can be worked. Why, I never dreamed so
dreadful a thing would come slap up against
us scouts. They want the people of Oakvale
to suspect us of being common, every-day
thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Ralph,&rdquo; said Hugh, firmly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the game could have been carried
out successfully at any time, even if none
of us so much as suspected a thing. Now that
you&rsquo;ve warned us, why, it&rsquo;s bound to fall flat.
Mayor Strunk and the women of this town
know the scouts too well to ever believe they&rsquo;d
disgrace their uniforms and honor badges by
stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Hugh, while I lay there
straining my ears like everything so&rsquo;s not to
lose much of what those plotters said, I was
thinking what a bully thing it would be if the
scouts could turn the tables on &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, Ralph, fix things so the fellows
who actually did the robbery would be nabbed
in the act&mdash;with the goods on&mdash;before they
found a chance to deposit any of the plunder
in the pockets of the scouts, or at their homes,
where it would be found when a search
started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had in mind,&rdquo; confessed the
other, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just what they deserved,&rdquo; declared
Hugh, &ldquo;and what some folks would call
retribution. We would save ourselves a whole
lot of trouble and explanations, and at the
same time might get rid of an undesirable
bunch of crooked people that Oakvale never
would miss.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you understand, Hugh, that I
was so worked up by what I managed to hear,
I felt nervous about staying too long, for fear
those men found me out. I tell you they&rsquo;re
mad enough to do almost anything to us
scouts. So I concluded it would be wise to
creep back, and get out of that same window
again before anything happened to me. This I
proceeded to do, and say, I breathed free again
when I found myself under the blue sky once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last you saw of them they were still
sitting in the old bowling alley place talking
things over, eh, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and figuring on how soon they could
do that nasty job, too, Hugh. From all I heard
they won&rsquo;t let the grass grow under their feet
before getting things moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we knew whose store was to be
robbed we would have something to work on,&rdquo;
suggested the scout leader, invitingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I think I know that much even now,&rdquo;
admitted Ralph. &ldquo;They seemed to be talking
about the easiest way to get in, and I heard
them mention old Mr. Ainslee several times, as
if it was to be his jewelry store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Hugh would not have been human if he had
not felt a chilling sensation pass over him upon
learning to what extreme lengths the enemies
of reform were willing to go in order to accomplish
their purpose. This was to upset the
prevailing conditions, and put the town back
into the old rut that was winked at by the
police and authorities, it being impolitic to
notice them too closely.</p>
<p>His determination was immediately taken,
for Hugh could often reach a conclusion as
speedily as on other occasions he took time to
make up his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, I was headed for home when you
stopped me,&rdquo; he went on to explain, &ldquo;but after
hearing what you&rsquo;ve just said, I want to have
Mr. Dobbs and the mayor know what those
desperate men are thinking of doing. Would
you mind coming with me and repeating your
story to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, Hugh; fact is, I expected that
you would ask me to do so, and I&rsquo;d made up
my mind what to say. Sure, I&rsquo;ll go along, and
repeat every word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Accordingly the pair trudged their way to
the parsonage, and were fortunate enough to
find the minister in his study. Mr. Dobbs was
a venerable man who always took a great interest
in all the activities of the Oakvale boys.
The scouts had no more sincere friend and
advocate than he proved to be, even when the
organization had been young, and much doubt
had been expressed among the better people of
the town as to the wisdom of allowing such a
movement to crystallize.</p>
<p>He greeted the boys with his customary
warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to have you drop in on me
this way,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;If it is in search of
any advice or other assistance, I shall be glad
to know what I can do for boys I think so
highly of. Tell me what your errand is this
time, Hugh, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the parson was highly indignant
when he heard to what actual depths of depravity
some of those men were willing to descend
in order to undo the work of the loyal
scouts, and the better elements among the residents
of Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;It all goes to prove how fearfully lax we
had become here,&rdquo; he observed after Ralph
had told all he knew. &ldquo;It also shows what a
crying necessity for a radical cleaning-up
movement there must have been when such
criminal elements, working to undermine the
characters of our young men and boys, as
these, could effect a lodgment in our town. It
was high time we woke up and took our coats
off for business. Ralph, I want to thank you
in the name of every respectable woman and
mother in Oakvale for what you have discovered
this day. &lsquo;Forewarned is forearmed,&rsquo;
they say, and before we are through with Gaffney,
Slimmons and Company, they will realize
that they have been up against a threshing
machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh liked to hear the old minister talk like
that, for he understood that Mr. Dobbs was
really a Civil War veteran, and in the old days
had once been known as the &ldquo;Fighting Parson.&rdquo;
If those unruly men fancied that because
he was a shepherd of a flock he would
not fight to save his pet lambs from the devouring
wolves they made the greatest mistake
of their whole lives.</p>
<p>So Mr. Dobbs quickly got the mayor on the
wire and asked him to come over to the parsonage
without a moment&rsquo;s delay; also to
fetch Doctor Kane along with him if he could
possibly do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to communicate that
will give you an electric shock, if that hint will
cause you to speed your car any the faster,
Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; the boys heard the minister say
in conclusion.</p>
<p>It was not a great while before they arrived,
for apparently the mayor had either met Doctor
Kane on the street or managed to find him
at his house. Then once more Ralph was influenced
to tell his startling story. He had
deeply interested listeners. Hugh could see
the mayor gritting his teeth as he had a way
of doing when thoroughly aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two wide-awake scouts have suggested,&rdquo;
said Mr. Dobbs, after everything had
been told, &ldquo;that we keep very quiet about this
discovery, and lay a trap so that when the
robbery is actually attempted we may arrest
those who are implicated. If they are caught
in the act, before they can have any opportunity
to place the blame on any one else, we
will have no trouble of ridding our town of unworthy
citizens. Mr. Mayor, it rests with you
to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would please me better!&rdquo; exclaimed
the mayor, strenuously. &ldquo;Before we
go into details with regard to any plan I want
to thank these brave boys from the bottom of
my heart on account of what the scouts have
done and are doing to purge Oakvale of every
element that stands, as a blot on a town&rsquo;s fair
name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE GOAL IN SIGHT.</span></h2>
<p>It was fine of the mayor to say that. Had
the women who had labored so long and so
arduously in order to accomplish this end
overheard what he remarked, they might have
whispered among themselves that it was a
great pity Mr. Strunk could not have reached
the desired resolution many months previously.</p>
<p>But then &ldquo;better late than never,&rdquo; and if his
eyes were now opened to the enormity of the
offenses that had previously been winked at
as unavoidable in a bustling community of
Oakvale&rsquo;s size and rapid growth, there was
good hope of the future.</p>
<p>Before Hugh and Ralph left the parsonage
to hurry home to supper they had heard the
whole thing thrashed out, and even found their
opinions asked by the trio of deeply interested
gentlemen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>A plan was fairly well arranged that would
serve as a trap, for from what Ralph had
caught, the conspirators would not be in position
to attempt the daring robbery until then.
In fact, as Ralph very well understood, it was
actually Hugh who proposed the idea upon
which the minister, Doctor Kane and the
mayor finally settled as promising the best results.
But then Ralph saw nothing strange
about that, for as a member of the scouts he
was accustomed to have Hugh Hardin naturally
take the lead in almost everything.</p>
<p>Ralph was greatly pleased. He considered,
and rightly, too, Hugh told him, that once
again his knowledge of woodcraft and the
Indian art of creeping up close to an enemy&rsquo;s
camp had proved of value to the cause he represented.
Many fellows similarly situated,
even if they had thought to make the attempt,
might have bungled, and only brought down
some sort of chastisement on their own heads
for their temerity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>It was to remain a dead secret; even the rest
of the scouts would not be told why Hugh
ordered them to be at their place of meeting on
the following night, prepared to have a number
of the stoutest and most adept chosen for
a special mission.</p>
<p>The mayor promised to see Chief Wallis on
the following morning and get him interested
in the matter, so that he and several of his
men could have a hand in trapping the thieves.
Just as likely as not these men would be in a
desperate mood, and liable to show fight when
they realized how completely the tables had
been turned upon them. Hence it was deemed
wise to have some of the regulars on the police
force handy in order to assist the scouts make
the arrests.</p>
<p>No doubt the home folks at the Hardin and
Kenyon domiciles must have thought the boys
were unusually serious all that evening, perhaps
absent-minded, for often they would
start when spoken to suddenly, as though
wrapped up in some far-away subject.</p>
<p>However, as it was known that their hearts
were concerned in the successful carrying out
of the cleaning up of Oakvale, allowances
were made for them. Fond mothers, though,
may have found themselves wondering if it
were really wise to allow such weights to rest
upon young shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Another day came around, and its duties
were taken up by the scouts with their accustomed
alacrity. Every fellow seemed to vie
with his mates in doing his share of the work
in a way that would allow of no fault finding.
There was indeed what might be called a
healthy rivalry among the scouts, to see who
could command the highest number of clean
scores; for Hugh had arranged matters in the
shape of a contest, to make it more interesting.</p>
<p>The opposition had not yet died out, for
when men have fallen into certain bad habits
that become as second nature, it is most difficult
to break the bonds binding them.</p>
<p>True, the drivers and chauffeurs in and
about Oakvale had by degrees become accustomed
to the new order of things, which was
moving along as smoothly as clockwork. They
found there was absolutely no need of any
friction, and that while occasionally held up
by the amateur &ldquo;traffic cop&rdquo; in order to allow
a safe passage for a squad of school children,
they really lost little or no time. Besides, a
vast amount of argument and hard words was
saved by this orderly way of running things
at congested crossings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Already the new system had borne fruit,
for the railway company, while not compelled
to do so by any town ordinance, doubtless falling
in with the general scheme of uplift, stationed
a flagman at the perilous crossing, who
would be on duty from six in the morning
until sundown.</p>
<p>Those of the scouts who had the duty of
searching for infractions of the health code
ran across the greatest trouble, because they
were dealing with private individuals, some of
whom nursed petty &ldquo;grouches&rdquo; against them
because compelled to do what the boys demanded
or take the chances of being summoned
before a Squire and heavily fined.</p>
<p>Hugh used considerable diplomacy in dealing
with these offenders. He did not wish the
scouts to make any enemies when it could be
avoided. So when there happened to be some
stubborn fellow who firmly believed he had a
right to do things that were offensive to the
neighbors and the community at large, just
because he was on his own grounds, and
threatened to go to law to resist, Hugh tried
other measures besides violence and threats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>In several instances he performed what
seemed next door to miracles, in the eyes of
the boys, and the amused people as well. Hugh
could &ldquo;blarney&rdquo; most any one into coming
around to his way of thinking, given half a
chance, was what Billy Worth always said,
and in fact the young scout master proved the
truth of this assertion in several instances.</p>
<p>One crabbed and rich old fellow in particular,
who had little to do with his neighbors,
but persisted in keeping several fierce dogs
that barked most of the night, upon being
threatened with the passage of a new law that
would proclaim such animals within the corporate
limits of the town a public nuisance if
complaint were handed in signed by six neighbors,
told them they could pass all the regulations
they wanted and he would take out an
injunction, which by the delay of the law
would allow him to do about as he pleased the
rest of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Judge Coffin, from the town of Lawrence,
whose acquaintance some of the scouts had
made at the time of the famous flood,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
when they were enabled to save several lives and
win the esteem of the entire community,
chancing to visit Oakvale on some official business
just about that time, confided to Hugh
the fact that unfortunately what Mr. Griffin
claimed was true, and that by successive injunctions
it was possible to fend off a decision
for months, sometimes years.</p>
<p>This was not the worst of it, for if one man
could baffle the desire of the community in
that way his example might become contagious
and the precedent thus set be copied
by others, until all the good the reform wave
had done would be lost.</p>
<p>So clever Hugh had figured out it was essential
that Mr. Griffin be won over to the cause,
even if it took much of his spare time to accomplish
the seemingly impossible result.</p>
<p>Like a wise general, Hugh first looked over
the field. He knew that when a battle is to
be fought the side that knows the various conformations
of the ground always possesses an
advantage over those less posted.</p>
<p>In making all sorts of inquiries Hugh
learned a lot about the past of this crabbed
old man who seemed so like vinegar. There
was a reason, it seemed, for his &ldquo;drawing
within his shell,&rdquo; and refusing to have more
than casual communication with his neighbors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Mr. Griffin had suffered a cruel shock many
years before, losing his wife and two lovely
children in a fire. One girl was left to him,
and she grew up to womanhood, gave him a
great deal of trouble, and finally ran away
with a worthless fellow. Some years afterwards,
the old gentleman, now become estranged
from the world that had treated him
so cruelly, went away, and came back with a
child he announced as his grandson, the last
of his stock, for the daughter had died.</p>
<p>Alas! this little boy was a cripple and deformed.
Hugh had seen him several times,
but the old man kept a strict watch, and allowed
no intruders in his grounds where those
dogs roamed at night time.</p>
<p>The hunchback was now all of ten years of
age, and when Hugh saw Mr. Griffin buying
some boys&rsquo; books before Christmas he understood
that the little fellow at least must love
to read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Here then was the scheme which Hugh
worked out. He had plenty of books that told
of the doings of Boy Scouts. Besides, he had
an old manual that he could easily spare. So
he bribed the grocer&rsquo;s boy, who daily visited
the Griffin home, and admitted that he chatted
with the hunchback frequently, to give Archibald
the package of books on the sly, and tell
him the leader of the Wolf Patrol had sent
them with his compliments to help a &ldquo;shut-in&rdquo;
realize what scout life meant.</p>
<p>Hugh heard from his kind act, for on the
very next day he received a splendid little note
from the boy, thanking him heartily for his
thoughtfulness, and saying that he would devour
those books &ldquo;ferociously,&rdquo; he was so
&ldquo;crazy&rdquo; about reading of what boys more fortunate
than himself were doing.</p>
<p>Hugh kept it up after that, and before long
there was a most friendly feeling springing
up between the two. One fine day Hugh was
surprised to have Mr. Griffin stop him on the
street, and he realized that the severe look
could leave the face of the well-named man
when he chose to drop the mask.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;My little grandchild has been telling me
about your kindness in sending him books to
read,&rdquo; the gentleman started to say. &ldquo;Now, I
have been very particular about the type of
books I select for him, because I want the poor
little fellow to know only the better side of
life. At first I was afraid you had broken
down the barrier I have erected, but when I
came to look over the handbook of the scouts,
and found what a splendid foundation the organization
is built upon I felt sure that books
written along similar lines could do a boy only
good. I am pleased to say that upon glancing
over those you sent him, I have been immensely
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered his hand to Hugh, something no
boy in Oakvale had ever known Mr. Griffin to
do in all the years past. Hugh flushed with a
sense of satisfaction upon realizing that he
was on the road to success, and that his diagnosis
of the stern old gentleman&rsquo;s real nature
had not been amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you do not think I was playing
a mean part in getting those books to Archibald,&rdquo;
he said, simply. &ldquo;We scouts feel for
any chap who is deprived of the glorious
chances we have to spend many good times in
the open. I thought he would be glad to learn
about scout life, even if he could never hope
to enjoy it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is more to the point,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Griffin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my eyes opened to the fact
that it is a bad thing for any man to allow
himself to remain in ignorance with what is
going on around him as the years progress. I
am ashamed to admit that I never dreamed
there had been such a vast revolution in the
training of boys during the years I&rsquo;ve kept
aloof from the world. I&rsquo;ve seen mention of
the scouts many times in my papers, but never
took the trouble to investigate&mdash;in fact,
treated the whole matter as somewhat of a
military movement copied after the Old World
methods. I am delighted to learn that such
is not the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went on to say Archibald was eager
to meet Hugh, and that if only he could come
over and take supper with them that evening
it would give both of the &ldquo;shut-ins&rdquo; great
pleasure indeed.</p>
<p>Such luck Hugh had hardly anticipated, but
he was only too glad to accept the invitation
in the spirit it was given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some more really splendid books I
want you to let him read,&rdquo; he went on to say
with spirit. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t object I&rsquo;ll come
over this very evening,&rdquo; for, as we happen to
know, the scout master believed in &ldquo;striking
when the iron is hot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>After that it was easy for Hugh. Once he
had gained entrance to the Griffin home he
found a means for occupying a place in the
hearts of both the hunchback boy and his
grandfather. By a wise system of approaching
the subject discreetly Hugh quickly found
a way of getting Mr. Griffin to change his
mind about keeping those noisy dogs.</p>
<p>It was once more a case of the gentle sun&rsquo;s
rays accomplishing what even the most violent
wind could not do.</p>
<p>Hugh never boasted of his victories, but in
some way the truth became known. Possibly
Mr. Griffin, now mingling more than in the
past with his neighbors, secretly amused, told
it himself. At any rate it served to add to
the laurels Hugh had already won as a diplomat,
as well as a scout leader.</p>
<p>So the good work went on. This incident
connected with Mr. Griffin and his pests of
barking dogs was only one example of how
the scouts managed to accomplish their ends.
It is not by mere promises of prosecution alone
that nuisances can be abated, for sometimes
reason goes a great ways toward effecting a
cure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>A few threats had been made, but so far
none of the boys had really suffered actual
violence. Truth to tell, the cowards who had
been bullies knew that when they assailed the
scout uniform they really went up against the
entire vested authority of the town as represented
by the mayor, the police, and the better
element of the citizens.</p>
<p>Speedy retaliation had fallen upon those astonished
offenders who had laughed at the
warnings given by the Auxiliary Police. They
realized that because a fellow is under a man&rsquo;s
size and wears a khaki uniform, it is no sign
that he cannot enforce his authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Things had apparently been going on swimmingly,
and there seemed every indication
that victory was in sight when Ralph by accident
overheard that plot to bring about the
undoing of the scouts in the estimation of the
town people. It was plainly the last desperate
effort of the opposition. If they were beaten
in this round the chances were there would
be a clean sweep to crown the efforts of those
who were working so hard for home protection
in Oakvale. It would have been proven
conclusively that a new rule must hereafter
be reckoned with, which was founded on
<i>order</i> and the rights of the community as
against private privileges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">BENJY&rsquo;S SUSPICIOUS ACTIONS.</span></h2>
<p>Really, it was strange how things crowded
into that particular day. Hugh was down
doing some errand in the shopping district of
the town when, by the merest accident, he
chanced to see Benjy Sherwood again.</p>
<p>The sight of Tom&rsquo;s high-strung younger
brother would be apt to interest Hugh at any
time nowadays, for it caused him to remember
that he had as yet been unable to carry his
promise into effect, owing to the great rush of
matters accumulating on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He was particularly interested, however,
when he saw what the boy was doing, for
plainly Benjy had some silver coins in his hand
which he was counting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Hugh jumped to a conclusion that gave him
a bad feeling in the region of his heart. When
a fellow is seen coming out of a bird store
where all sorts of pets are kept, and counting
silver coins from one hand to the other, the
most natural conclusion is that he must have
been selling something there, and wants to
make sure he has received the right amount.</p>
<p>Hugh chanced to know that Benjy had been
deeply interested in Belgian hares, and received
a present of a handsome pair of them
on Christmas, of which he had been exceedingly
fond. Hugh wondered if it could be
possible that the boy, hard pressed for the
means to pay some &ldquo;debt of honor,&rdquo; as he considered
it, had actually sacrificed his pets.</p>
<p>The thought of what a hold that gaming
habit must have gained upon poor Benjy filled
the scout master with dismay. He took a few
steps past the store, and then felt compelled
to yield to an irresistible impulse to make
sure; so, turning back, he walked into the
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Hugh had often been there before, for he
was himself interested in fancy pigeons, and
had a coop of &ldquo;homers&rdquo; at home from which
he anticipated raising some fine youngsters,
which he could take many miles from home
and find awaiting him on his return. Indeed,
he aspired some day to possess famous fliers
that might cover a thousand miles, and still
find their way home inside of a few days.</p>
<p>So Hugh strolled around looking at the
coops containing all sorts of pets both in fur
and feather, from cunning pet dogs to fowls
with pedigrees, and parrots that could say
dozens of strange phrases, or even sing in a
croaking fashion.</p>
<p>Finally Hugh approached the owner of the
shop, who was busily engaged with some work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have any Belgian hares,
Mr. Huggins?&rdquo; he asked, in a casual way, as
though he had looked around and failed to
notice any in the various cages or runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that reminds me I forgot to put that
pair in the cage, I was so busy after the boy
left,&rdquo; remarked the owner of the store, as he
hurried over to an old basket that had a cover
to it, and from which he drew a struggling
object with long ears, which he tossed into an
empty cage, to be presently followed by a second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s last doubt was now laid. He had
recognized the Belgian hares by certain well-remembered
marks, as once the property of
Benjy Sherwood, who must have sacrificed
them for a particular object.</p>
<p>When Hugh remembered what he feared
that object might be he found himself shivering,
he was so sorry for poor Tom, whose
heart seemed so sore these days.</p>
<p>More than ever was Hugh bothered to know
just how he should go about gaining the confidence
of that high-strung lad. He had found
a way to gain the heart of such a scoffer and
doubter as Mr. Griffin, whom everybody
deemed beyond hope. Surely there must be
some method he could apply to reach Benjy&rsquo;s
confidence, so that he might coax him to join
the scouts, and drop those suspicious companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start right in to-morrow,&rdquo; Hugh told
himself, vigorously, as he left the pet shop
and headed for home. &ldquo;Until this other business
is settled and the coast cleared, I mustn&rsquo;t
allow myself to be tempted to take up any side
issues. But if all goes well, and to-morrow
sees things turn our way, as I hope, then I
promise myself that I&rsquo;ll turn to Tom&rsquo;s trouble
and help him out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>All the rest of that afternoon he could not
keep his thoughts away from what he had
learned about Benjy. It seemed as if the boy
must be sinking fast in the quicksands of the
treacherous stream into which he had so boldly
waded. Unless prompt measures were taken
for his rescue, Hugh feared Benjy would ere
long be so deeply involved that such a thing
as saving him must become three times as
difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop over and see Tom to-night,&rdquo; he
promised himself, as he sat awaiting the summons
to supper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember meeting
him all day, that is, to speak to. He&rsquo;s beginning
to believe by this time that I&rsquo;ve about
forgotten my promise. Poor Tom, I&rsquo;m sorry
for him as can be, and only hope we can convince
Benjy he can get three times as much
real fun out of joining the scouts as keeping
company with that tough crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was not as sanguine as his words
might indicate. He knew what a grip habit
can take upon most boys, and how once they
yield to the allurements of vices it proves very
difficult for them to break away, or even acknowledge
they are on the wrong path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>He had several half-formed plans, any one
of which he might be able to work upon, after
he had consulted with Tom. The latter was
one of the sturdiest of the scouts, and Hugh
particularly wanted him to be present on that
night watch. He partly feared Tom might
not feel inclined to come forth, and it was
partly with the intention of gaining his consent
that Hugh meant to drop around after supper
and see him.</p>
<p>It happened several things came up to delay
him. First a report was brought in by a
member of the troop that was of sufficient
importance to merit immediate attention. So
Hugh had to talk with Chief Wallis over the
wire. Then something else arose that took
another half-hour of his precious time.</p>
<p>When finally the decks were cleared it was
almost half-past seven, and the meeting had
been called for eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must hustle if I mean to have a talk with
Tom before we both go over to the meeting
room,&rdquo; was what Hugh told himself, as he
snatched up his cap and made for the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>He had hardly gained the street before he
ran across two of the boys heading in the
direction of the church, where a room had
been placed at the disposal of the troop, together
with the free use of electric light, and
heat in winter time.</p>
<p>At the next corner, however, Hugh stopped
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t go all the way with you,
Chester and Dale, but I&rsquo;ve got an errand over
at Tom Sherwood&rsquo;s house. I&rsquo;ll be with you
later on, and will fetch Tom with me. My
lips are sealed about the object of this special
meeting until then, so there&rsquo;s no use trying to
coax me to speak. Those who are selected
will be told everything, and the rest put on
their honor not to say a word about anything
they suspect to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! you certainly have got us all guessing
good and hard, Hugh,&rdquo; laughed Dale
Evans, who belonged to the Otter Patrol. &ldquo;I
sure hope I&rsquo;ll be one of those lucky chosen
ones, so I can know what all this mystery
means.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! any old thing is liable to happen in
such exciting times as these,&rdquo; said Chester
Brownell, who was one of the best athletes in
the troop, and would assuredly be picked out
by Hugh as one of the guards of the night;
though Chester, being in complete ignorance
concerning matters, could not know this.</p>
<p>Hugh hurried as best he could toward the
Sherwood home, which was some distance
away from the corner where he parted company
with the other scouts. There was little
chance that Tom might have already started
for the rendezvous, but somehow Hugh suspected
the other was feeling too anxious to
take any pleasure in going to a called meeting,
when he could just as well stay at home and
worry his mind with those questions that
would not down.</p>
<p>Tom himself came to the door in answer to
his knock, and seemed to be a little surprised
to find who was there. Hugh thought he
looked more gloomy than ever, though possibly
that had been a faint gleam of revived
hope that flittered athwart Tom&rsquo;s long face at
seeing the scout master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you mightn&rsquo;t come out to-night,
Tom,&rdquo; said Hugh, as he pushed in without
even waiting for an invitation, &ldquo;and so I made
up my mind to step over and be sure of you.
Fact is, Tom, there&rsquo;s going to be something
planned of great importance to our cause.
I&rsquo;ve depended on you to be one of six or eight
of the brawniest fellows in the troop to stand
by and help us win a great victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked somewhat impressed, though he
shook his head sadly as he went on to say in
reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had almost made up my mind,
Hugh, that I didn&rsquo;t care to go out to-night.
Fact is, to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m so miserable
these days that I don&rsquo;t seem to care whether
school keeps or not&mdash;lost my appetite, and
even think of resigning from the scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh slapped him on the back in his cheery
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me hear you make that threat
again, Tom,&rdquo; he said, in pretended severity.
&ldquo;We need you too much every day to let you
go. Besides, your influence is going to count
for a heap after the town is cleared up. You
don&rsquo;t know how much it means to have a scout
in good standing in a family. But what ails
you, Tom? Has anything new happened to
give you the blues again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the reply, accompanied with
a deep sigh from the heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">THE REVELATION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it is all about, Tom, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked Hugh, as he followed the other
upstairs to his own room. Somehow, Tom
seemed to feel that they ought to be alone so
his mother might not overhear what passed
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just close the door, Hugh, before I say
anything,&rdquo; remarked Tom, &ldquo;though for that
matter there&rsquo;s no danger Benjy will interrupt
us, because he&rsquo;s gone off for the evening. This
time I&rsquo;m glad to tell you it&rsquo;s to a sociable
they&rsquo;re having over at our church for the
young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner when saying this showed that
Tom would be a happy fellow, indeed, if he
could only know that every night Benjy was
away from home, he was enjoying himself in
similar innocent amusements as on this particular
occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, you see, Hugh,&rdquo; he continued,
after finding a seat close to his visitor,
&ldquo;for a little while now Benjy&rsquo;s been acting
mighty decent, and I&rsquo;ve come to let myself take
on more hope than I had the last time you and
I talked it over. He seems more like his old
self, and was even asking some questions
about the scouts, though up to now he&rsquo;s never
seemed to care a thing about our organization,
you remember. But it was too good to
last, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering what he had seen that afternoon,
with Benjy counting silver coins he had
received from the bird fancier, Hugh himself
was obliged to mentally confess that it looked
very much that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, please, Tom!&rdquo; he urged when the
other paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is how it happened,&rdquo; explained
the other, slowly, as though he hated to talk
about such a painful subject, and had to force
himself to take it up only because he knew it
was necessary he should enter into details.
&ldquo;After supper this evening, just before Benjy
went out, he gave me a quick look when he
thought I wasn&rsquo;t paying any attention, and
then slipped upstairs. I waited for a little
while, and then just couldn&rsquo;t stand it any
longer, so I managed to leave the sitting room
and go up the back stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping on my tiptoes, I moved along the
upper hall in the half shadows to where I
could watch the door of my room. It was
partly open, and there was a light inside, but
I couldn&rsquo;t see Benjy at all, though I could hear
him moving about as if looking for something.
Then the light suddenly went out, and he came
out. Hugh, it made me as cold as ice when
I even heard him chuckling to himself as he
hurried to his own room, just as if he thought
he had played a good joke on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t know you were so
close to him?&rdquo; asked Hugh when Tom stopped
talking to swallow as though something
seemed to be choking him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and as soon as he disappeared in his
own room I slipped downstairs again, and took
up the book I had been reading. He went off
a few minutes afterwards, and called out
good-night to all as cheery as he used to in
the old days before he got going with that
tough set.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come up here and look around to
find out what he had been doing?&rdquo; asked the
scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to the worst kind, Hugh, but it
seemed as if I just couldn&rsquo;t. I was almost
afraid to look for fear of making some more
discoveries that would upset me. Why, Hugh,
honest to goodness, I feel so weary this very
night you would think I was an old man, and
yet I&rsquo;ll be sixteen to-morrow, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hugh told him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always my
principle, when I&rsquo;ve got a disagreeable task to
perform, to get at it right away. The longer
you wait, Tom, the worse it gets for you. The
only way is to shut your teeth hard together,
and pitch in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Hugh&mdash;sure you must
be. I&rsquo;ve been silly to hold back. No matter
what I learn, the truth can&rsquo;t be any worse than
this terrible uncertainty that&rsquo;s gripping me,
and making me shiver as if I had the ague
again.&rdquo; He jumped from his seat as though
determined to carry his words into effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the first thing I ought to look at
is my trunk, eh, Hugh?&rdquo; he went on to say,
fumbling in a pocket for his keys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know better than I do where
you keep your valuables,&rdquo; said the other, trying
to appear merry, though somehow, Tom
did not respond to any appreciable extent. &ldquo;I
see that since that other time I was up here
you&rsquo;ve changed your way of leaving your
trunk unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom flushed, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I tell you it galled me to think I was
locking it against my own brother,&rdquo; he said,
tremulously, &ldquo;but then I remembered that it
is a sin to put temptation in the path of any
fellow whose weakness you know. Though
for that matter a common key would unlock
this trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He soon threw back the lid and bent over,
fumbling through the contents. Hugh stood
close by, watching him with more or less curiosity
and interest. He saw that Tom was evidently
in fear and trembling, as though constantly
dreading lest he make some unpleasant
discovery.</p>
<p>As he proceeded he seemed to regain a portion
of his former confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my little savings bank all right,
Hugh, and no one could ever manage to get
anything out of that in the short time he was
in my room, even if the trunk could be opened.
So far as I can see, nothing has been taken out
of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he allowed the lid to drop again Tom
was looking more or less relieved. Evidently
his main concern had been in connection with
the money, he had in that little metal bank, for
if Benjy had meant to take anything it would
seem that ready cash would tempt him more
than all else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! perhaps, Hugh, he didn&rsquo;t come in here
for that,&rdquo; he broke out with. &ldquo;I remember
now that sometimes in the past when Benjy
was going out to a party he used to want to
fix his tie, and brush his hair before the mirror
in my room, for he said the light was better
here. It may have been that, Hugh, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout master understood that poor Tom
was like a drowning man clutching at a straw
in hopes of keeping himself afloat. Hugh himself
might have been inclined to look at the
matter from much the same standpoint only
for that strange incident of the afternoon,
which he could not explain, try as he might,
save along very unpleasant lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, Tom,&rdquo; he hastened to say,
&ldquo;though now you&rsquo;re about it, in order to ease
your mind, and leave no stone unturned, I
should think you had better make a clean
sweep in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean search every drawer in my
chiffonier and dresser, Hugh?&rdquo; demanded
Tom. &ldquo;I can do that easily enough, but surely
he wouldn&rsquo;t think to take any of my clothes.
I might tell if he&rsquo;d mussed around in the
drawers searching for my savings bank,
though, because I keep everything just so; and
the clean shirt I expect to wear to-morrow
morning I placed on the top of the pile. That&rsquo;s
my habit as a scout to have things kept as
neat as wax. Why, Hugh, my mother laughs
at me, and calls me a fussy old maid, you
know, all on account of those habits of thrift
and preparedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started in at the bureau drawers for
some reason or other, and as he opened each
one and ran his eye over the contents, Tom
continued to talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like nothing has been bothered that
I can notice, Hugh. Here&rsquo;s another drawer
containing some of my surveying instruments,
for, with Bud Morgan, I&rsquo;m still interested
along those lines, though of late I haven&rsquo;t
been out afield with him. I was a little afraid
one of these instruments might be gone. You
see, they&rsquo;re worth considerable money, and
were made a present to me by an old uncle
who&rsquo;s interested in my career. But, so far as I
can see, not a single thing is missing, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a positive air of relief in Tom&rsquo;s
voice when he said this. Undoubtedly the
contents of that drawer of instruments had
been giving him more anxiety than he had confessed,
and he was glad that no unpleasant
discovery had developed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest will be just an apology of a
search, Hugh, because, you see, there&rsquo;s absolutely
nothing worth taking besides these
things. Still, to satisfy my mind as you say,
perhaps I&rsquo;d just better run through the
drawers of the chiffonier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started at the top one. Hugh indolently
watched his progress downward, never
dreaming that there would come anything out
of the ordinary. Suddenly, as Tom started to
open the drawer that he said contained his
clean shirts, the scout master saw him give a
big start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Tom stammered, at the
same time taking out a long package carefully
tied up, and with something written on the
outside. Hugh also noticed that an envelope
was pinned on to the paper covering.</p>
<p>Somehow or other Hugh experienced a
thrill. It was as if he had a premonition that
something in the nature of a great surprise
was coming. Tom was staring hard at what
he saw written on the paper. Then he snatched
the note, and with trembling hands commenced
to get at the enclosure, while the scout
master strove to analyze his feelings from the
flitting expressions that chased each other
across his face.</p>
<p>He saw Tom read on, first with incredulity,
then sheer amazement, and finally a look of
supreme joy came upon his countenance that
spoke even louder than his words could the
revelation that had come to his faithful heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Hugh! Hugh! would you believe it,
Benjy&rsquo;s all right? He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;oh! I&rsquo;m so
happy I hardly know what to say! Read his
note, Hugh, please!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">CLEAR SAILING AHEAD.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh took the missive from Tom&rsquo;s hand,
and at the same time managed to see what was
written on the outside of the carefully done-up
package that the other had laid on the top of
the chiffonier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To Brother Tom: Wishing him many
happy returns of his birthday. From
Benjy!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even before Hugh read a single word in
the note he believed he had a pretty clear comprehension
as to the true state of affairs. His
heart, too, was bounding with sudden relief
over the happy outcome of the troublesome
matter, although it was not to be expected that,
being an outsider, Hugh could feel one-quarter
the joy that filled Tom&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The letter ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Tom:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the best thing I could think of
to get you. It&rsquo;s a whole lot better than
your old racket ever was, which I am having
repaired for my own use. I&rsquo;ve taken
a liking to tennis lately. And, Tom, you&rsquo;ll
be glad to know I&rsquo;ve thrown that whole
crowd overboard, and I mean to make an
application to join the scouts the first
chance I get. Perhaps you would like to
propose my name. Many happy returns
of the day, Tom. I&rsquo;m beginning to realize
what a whole lot I owe you for keeping
everlastingly at me, even when I kept
turning you down. But I want to forget
all that now, for it can never happen again
with me.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Your brother, Benjy.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hugh folded up that note with a feeling of
delight he had seldom experienced before.
Then Benjy was turning out to be a splendid
sort of fellow! Hugh anticipated he might
prove to be that once he made up his mind to
break away from those evil connections that
were pulling him into the mire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>He must have been really hunting for the
old tennis racquet on that other occasion when
caught rummaging through Tom&rsquo;s trunk. He
had appeared confused because he feared his
secret might be discovered. He had not only
taken every cent he had in his bank to pay for
the new racquet, but had actually sold his valuable
Belgian hares in order to make up the
amount he still owed at the sporting goods
store.</p>
<p>By now Tom had snatched up the package
and managed to get it undone. He uttered
cries of sincere admiration and delight when
he saw what an elegant tennis racquet was revealed.
His eyes were swimming with tears
as he looked at Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Hugh!&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;will I ever be
able to forgive myself for thinking all those
bad things about him? I never felt so ashamed
in my life as I do now. But I&rsquo;m going to make
amends for it, see if I don&rsquo;t, Hugh. Look
what a dandy racquet he got me, will you?
Spent every cent he had saved for his Fourth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Hugh hardly knew whether he ought to relate
what he had discovered. The temptation
to do so overcame his scruples. Besides, now
that Benjy&rsquo;s innocence had been assured, he
thought it too good to be hidden under a bushel
by silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you something, Tom,&rdquo; he
went on to say, with a smile. &ldquo;Queer, isn&rsquo;t it,
that often the very things we fear for most
turn out to be for the very best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom immediately began to show new interest.
How his fine eyes sparkled, and upon his
face that worried look could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is there anything more good coming,
Hugh?&rdquo; he cried, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to judge for yourself,&rdquo; replied
the scout master, after which he proceeded to
relate how he had seen Benjy coming out of the
bird store kept by Mr. Huggins, and counting
some silver, also how the discovery had filled
him with dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only natural it should, you understand,
Tom,&rdquo; he went on to say in apology,
&ldquo;after what we suspected. But I made up my
mind I would learn what he had been doing in
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>When Tom heard about the selling of
Benjy&rsquo;s pet Belgian hares he lowered his head
suddenly as though he did not want his friend
to see that his eyes were swimming, for as a
rule, boys have a prejudice against appearing
weak. Hugh respected his brotherly emotion,
for he knew that it must be complete joy that
affected the other now, and not anxiety.</p>
<p>By the time Hugh finished speaking Tom
managed to get a fresh grip on himself, even
though his voice did tremble somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I&rsquo;m bound to redeem those long-eared
little animals if I have to borrow the
money to do it with!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;To think
of his making that great big sacrifice just for
me! I know how fond Benjy&rsquo;s been of his
pets! Oh! Hugh, when you came in here little
did I dream what glorious news there was
going to be sprung on me! I was feeling away
down in the cellar, and now, well, I seem to be
on the roof looking up into the beautiful
heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was not such a bad description of
Tom&rsquo;s feelings, considering the fact that he
was only a matter-of-fact boy, and struggling
along under unusual emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Hugh did not attempt to explain how possibly
it might be just as well to allow Benjy to
make his sacrifice. It gave the boy more or
less satisfaction, and would always be a link
connecting him with his brother. Later on
Hugh might urge upon Tom the wisdom of letting
matters stand just as they were.</p>
<p>He handled the racquet and praised its good
qualities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pretty smart of the boy hiding it in
the drawer containing your shirts,&rdquo; Hugh
went on to say, laughing; &ldquo;especially as he
figured that to-morrow was your regular morning
for putting on a clean one, and you would
be sure to discover the package the first thing
on your birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it, though?&rdquo; said Tom, chuckling.
&ldquo;That shows, Tom, that Benjy would make a
good scout, because he has the sense of observation
well developed to start with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it does, Tom, and some day before
long I hope to see your brother wearing
the honored khaki. It&rsquo;s a proud family that can
boast of <i>two</i> scouts, let me tell you. And once
Benjy joins&mdash;no danger of his ever going back.
A world will open up to his eyes that he never
dreamed existed. Old things will have passed
away and everything become new, once he has
put on the magic spectacles of scoutcraft. I&rsquo;ve
been told that by a dozen fellows, and I know
what a change it makes in most boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Tom began to wrap the precious racquet
carefully up again in the paper that had been
around it when he made his startling discovery.
How tenderly he handled the present given by
his brother. Hugh even thought that all other
gifts showered on Tom in times past must sink
into utter insignificance when compared with
this special one; for it represented, in his eyes,
the dissolution of those serious doubts that had
of late been weighing down his spirits until his
heart felt like lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m meaning to put it back just where I
found it, you see, Hugh,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and
make things look as if no one had touched it.
Luckily the envelope wasn&rsquo;t sealed, so I didn&rsquo;t
destroy the same. You may wonder why I do
that, and I&rsquo;ll tell you. I want to open it again
in the morning just as if I had found it for the
first time. Then there&rsquo;s another reason, you
see, Hugh; Benjy might get home to-night
ahead of me, and finding that I hadn&rsquo;t shown
up yet, take a notion to step in here just to have
a last peep and a pat at his package. I
wouldn&rsquo;t like him to know I had been investigating
ahead of time, you understand, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The scout master could read between the
lines. He realized that not for the world
would repentant Tom want Benjy to suspect
he had been looking all through his room in the
fear and expectation of making a distressing
discovery that would implicate the younger
brother. Nor could Hugh blame the other for
wanting to conceal such a humiliating thing as
this.</p>
<p>Accordingly the packet was carefully put on
top of the clean shirts in the drawer. To all
appearances it lay just as Benjy had placed it,
and if he did peep in the receptacle, there was
nothing to tell him that the well-tied bundle
had been disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s a big load off my shoulders,&rdquo;
said Tom, with a look of relief. &ldquo;Now, Hugh,
I&rsquo;m ready to go with you, and do anything you
ask of me. Why, I feel that light-hearted I
could almost fly,&rdquo; and he flapped his arms as
though they were wings, an action that caused
Hugh to laugh aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just hold your horses a bit, Tom,&rdquo; he
advised. &ldquo;I have need of your services to-night,
and it would be a shame to have you take
a flight. Suppose you get your cap and come
along with me to the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be something serious doing,
Hugh, if all this mystery counts for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly is, Tom. You&rsquo;ll learn about
it as soon as I&rsquo;ve picked out the scouts I want
to serve with me. They&rsquo;re all going to be
husky fellows like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me worked up to top-notch
speed, Hugh, with what you say,&rdquo; said Tom,
scurrying around, and looking for his cap,
which he found behind a chair where it had
evidently fallen when he tossed it aside earlier
in the evening. &ldquo;But no matter what it all
means I&rsquo;m with you to the last lick. I feel as
if I could whip my weight in wildcats. Lead
the way, and every scout you want will follow
you, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the twain passed out and headed for
the rendezvous, where they were likely to find
full twenty-five fellows in khaki impatiently
awaiting the coming of their leader, and an explanation
of this unusual &ldquo;called&rdquo; meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">PUTTING THE CLAMPS ON.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh had figured it all out, and decided that
the first thing he would do after the business
part of the meeting had been carried through,
would be to pick the fellows who were to help
guard the jewelry establishment with some of
the regular police force, so as to surprise the
thieves, if they should come as expected.</p>
<p>He believed it might be unwise to tell the
others anything about the plan of campaign.
This was not because he had reason to suspect
the loyalty of a single scout, but boys will talk
as well as girls, and unwittingly a fellow might
let something escape him that, through devious
channels, would be carried to the ears of those
who were concerned in the contemplated raid
on the store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>This plan was carried out to the letter.
Those whose names were not on the list of
lucky ones felt a little aggrieved, but at the
same time they knew it would do no good to
enter a complaint. Hugh had promised they
were to be given full particulars as soon as
possible. He assured them also that it was a
move in the interests of the grand project that
engaged their labors&mdash;cleaning up Oakvale.</p>
<p>Once he found himself left with seven stout
chums, Hugh proceeded to gather them around
him, and explained what was in the air. He
had a most attentive audience, and it would
have been amusing to any one interested in
boys to watch the expressions of wonder and
growing delight that gradually crept over their
faces as they drank in his words.</p>
<p>Say what you will, the seed of adventure has
always taken root deep down in the hearts of
every healthy boy. The mere fact that they
were scouts, and had promised to observe the
rules of the organization whose badge they so
proudly wore, did not mean that they must
stifle this feeling, which, if directed along the
right channels, does a boy ten times as much
good as harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Dozens of eager questions poured in upon
Hugh as soon as he had managed to tell them
about the dastardly plot that had been hatched
up by those desperate men who realized they
were getting near the end of their rope, and
that the energy of the scouts was primarily responsible
for the whole thing.</p>
<p>Hugh acted with considerable patience and
answered as best he might. He realized that
under similar conditions he, too, might have
felt inclined to ask for further information, because
it was a tremendous subject, truth to tell,
and difficult to grapple with in the beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make our way by a round-about route
to a place appointed,&rdquo; he went on to explain,
&ldquo;and there we&rsquo;ll find Chief Wallis waiting for
us. He will have three of his men along with
him, all that can be spared from their night
duties. Between us we&rsquo;ll probably fix it so
that a complete cordon will be thrown around
the jewelry store they&rsquo;ve picked out for robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>How they hung upon his every word! Hugh
would know just how to place them in order
that they might be able to throw themselves
upon the night prowlers after the latter had
actually started to break into the store. Hugh
had explained that they must not be premature
in unmasking their batteries, or the thieves
might find a loophole by means of which they
could escape from the meshes of the law.</p>
<p>When Hugh decided that it was time they
started to effect a junction with the regular
police; he warned his followers for the last
time how to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it comes to actual fighting,&rdquo; he said, impressively,
&ldquo;remember, you must leave <i>that</i> to
the officers, who are armed to bear the brunt of
the attack. We can throw ourselves on any
fellow, if the chance offers, and hold him down.
But all that will be arranged exactly after we
meet the other guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took them along an unfrequented street
and by making several detours, the little group
finally found the threatened store looming up
close by.</p>
<p>Hugh gave a prearranged signal and received
a soft reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief is over there in that dense shadow,&rdquo;
he whispered to the rest. &ldquo;We must slip
along and join him. First, Tom, here, can go,
and drop down when he finds himself in the
dark spot. Then Alec will follow, and in regular
order Buck, Ralph, Jack, Bud and Sam are
to imitate him. I&rsquo;ll fetch up the rear. Make a
move, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all on their mettle, and besides,
had the reputation of being clever scouts, well
versed in most of the secrets of woodcraft.
Consequently the maneuver was carried out
without a single hitch. Before many minutes
passed Hugh, having arrived on the spot,
found his chums crouching there close by the
Chief.</p>
<p>In low whispers the head of the Oakvale
police force now explained their plan of campaign.
It was not known whether any hostile
eye kept watch over the threatened store or not,
but they must always believe that such might
be the case, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>That principle was also in line with a scout&rsquo;s
education, and pleased the boys exceedingly.
They had been taught never to underestimate
an enemy, and that it were far better to waste
time in taking precautions than have over-confidence
ruin the best-laid plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>One of the police and three of the scouts
were to remain outside the building, and their
part in the enterprise was easily guessed. If
the thieves were like most of their class they
would very likely leave one of their number
without to keep watch and give a signal should
any sudden peril loom up. It was to secure
that sentry that the force detailed to stay in
the open had been marked off.</p>
<p>Hugh with the rest and the Chief meant to
enter the store. He had visited it often and
ought to be well acquainted with its every detail.
Even at that Hugh never left a thing to
chance when he could help it. That very afternoon,
after he had left Ralph and the others,
the boy had made some sort of excuse to drop
in at Ainslee&rsquo;s establishment. With his scout
ability he had been able to make a mental map,
and had noted every particular of the store, so
that he believed he could, if necessary, get
around in the dark without colliding with
showcases or pillars or counters.</p>
<p>Chief Wallis must have found a way to communicate
with the proprietor of the store, for
he certainly had a key that opened the side
door, through which numerous shadowy figures
now silently slipped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Here again Hugh proved of considerable
value, for it was he who really directed the
others where to hide so that they might divide
their force. The Chief had a pocket electric
light along with him, but he hesitated to make
use of it, lest some one passing and repassing
the front of the store, and looking in, take
notice of the strange glow, and communicate
the alarm to his fellows.</p>
<p>Talking was absolutely forbidden among the
scouts. They could only indicate the tremendous
interest they were taking in the proceedings
by numerous sly digs in the ribs, after the
manner of lively boys unduly repressed. None
of these were given with such vigor as to elicit
a gasp or groan.</p>
<p>How still it seemed after they had been
posted in their hiding places. Some of the
scouts must have thought they could actually
hear the beating of their own hearts, such was
the stress under which they labored.</p>
<p>Luckily Hugh had used discretion when
making his selections. He had not chosen them
merely for brawn alone, but for an ability to
keep a good grip on their spirits, and bravely
face exciting conditions that might well try the
nerves of experienced officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>An hour passed. It did not slip by, as most
of the waiting scouts would have readily
agreed. In fact, that was one of the longest
hours they ever knew, and as ten boomed from
the church clock, they could hardly believe their
ears, for surely, they figured, it must be that a
longer time had elapsed.</p>
<p>Hugh allowed them a chance to change their
positions when cramped, but insisted that it
be done with due regard to caution. They
could not tell when suspicious ears would be
listening for any sound to indicate trouble.
When the thieves did come they would do so&mdash;silently,
and without any trumpet to announce
their mission.</p>
<p>The second hour was worse by far than the
first. How their lower limbs did seem to want
to &ldquo;go to sleep,&rdquo; as the boys termed it when
circulation of blood ceased, and a species of
numbness resulted. Various were the remedies
resorted to in order to overcome this unpleasant
feeling. When eleven struck some of the
crouching figures moved uneasily and came as
near groaning as they dared.</p>
<p>Still, it could not be long now before something
was likely to happen, Hugh whispered to
Tom, with orders to pass it along the line, and
then become mute again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Hugh himself was wondering whether or
not all these preparations were doomed to disappointment.
What if the grand scheme had
fallen through, or the intended robbery been
postponed because of good and sufficient reasons?
He felt that he would be grievously disappointed,
for somehow he had come to set
much store on being able to strike this telling
blow against the worst of the offenders of decency
in Oakvale.</p>
<p>He had an impression that this would mark
the final effort to break down the new order of
things; that if the robbery of the jewelry establishment,
and the subsequent placing of the
crime at the door of certain innocent parties,
could be balked in its perpetration, the last barrier
would have yielded, and after that the reform
people would have a clean order of
things.</p>
<p>It must have been pretty near the midnight
hour when a door was heard to close. That
little piece of carelessness on the part of the
thieves was likely to cost them dear in the end,
since it gave ample warning of their coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>One soft hiss from Hugh and every scout
flattened himself as low as he could, so that
discovery might not follow in case those who
had entered the store produced any sort of
light.</p>
<p>They were not experts in this profession,
Hugh guessed, for they took certain chances
of being discovered while at work. Nevertheless,
they depended on the vigilance of their
outpost stationed on the street, as well as the
reputation acquired by the town night officers
for shirking their work when on beat.</p>
<p>When it was seen that the two men had actually
commenced operations on the big safe, as
though meaning to break into it, and have &ldquo;the
game as well as the name&rdquo; now that they had
gone to all this trouble, the concealed boys
could hardly keep from leaping up and throwing
themselves upon the robbers. Only the
mastery which Hugh possessed over them prevented
such a break; for it had become second
nature now with them to wait for orders before
making a move.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was no need of waiting
further before showing their hand. Those
outside could take warning when they heard a
sudden sound of confusion within, and pounce
upon the &ldquo;outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The Chief had reserved to himself the giving
of the signal, and every one, man and boy
alike, knew what his particular part in the
surprise attack was to be. If everything went
right it would be like the mechanical action of
clockwork machinery. Hugh hoped no cog in
the wheel would miss connections, because that
might interfere with the ultimate success of
the whole scheme.</p>
<p>The two men were bending low when there
came a sharp exclamation. They would have
started up like a flash, but even then their
action was just a trifle too late, for something
heavy dropped upon them, and flattened both
out upon the floor.</p>
<p>It was really the body of the Chief that had
accomplished this coup. Before either one of
the astonished rascals could squirm out from
under his ponderous form the scouts became
as busy as beavers. Hugh flashed the little
light handed over to him by the Chief, and kept
it playing full upon the focussing point where
all their interest was centred. Consequently
Tom, Sam and the rest of the fellows had no
trouble in distributing themselves along the
length of the recumbent figures of the disturbed
thieves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Hugh felt sure that, as Billy Worth would
have said, it &ldquo;was all over but the shouting,&rdquo;
when he saw how well pinned down the desperate
rascals found themselves. He advanced
closer so as to be in a position to carry out any
wishes of the astute police head, such as slipping
the waiting handcuffs over the wrists of
the prisoners, and rendering them harmless, so
that they might be stood up and looked over.</p>
<p>Several loud outcries from beyond the door
announced that those who had been given the
task of trapping the third member of the audacious
set had taken a hint just as soon as they
heard the first sound within the store. They
soon came into the building pushing a man before
them, who was lined up with the other
pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Three more disgusted-looking fellows had
likely never before been paraded in front of the
scouts. Just as Hugh and Ralph had suspected,
they turned out to be Gaffney, the former
owner of the poolroom and gymnasium
that had been abolished by orders of council;
Slimmons, once the athletic trainer in the public
schools before he took so heavily to drink
that he had to be let go; and that third man, a
stranger whom Hugh believed must be secretly
interested in seeing Oakvale&rsquo;s reform movement
slump, perhaps because he had some connection
with the interests of those who had
been defying the law.</p>
<p>Caught in the act, it was likely to go hard
with the three. Gaffney did tell his mates not
to open their mouths, but to leave it to him to
get them clear. Hugh believed they were leaning
on a broken reed if they entertained any
hope that political influence was going to keep
the outraged law from taking its course. That
day had gone for Oakvale, and the degrading
elements which such men as Gaffney represented,
would have to emigrate to other quarters
if they hoped to be able to continue to ply
their evil vocations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The trio of prisoners were marched through
the now deserted streets to the lockup, where
Chief Wallis would see to it that there was no
chance for a getaway. The seven scouts, who
accompanied Hugh and the little group of officers
surrounding the prisoners, would never
be able to forget the exciting experiences of
that night. It would have to go down upon the
annals of scout achievements, and serve to add
one more glorious event to the string of exploits
carried to a successful conclusion by the
boys of the Oakvale Troop.</p>
<p>Before Hugh dismissed his followers he took
occasion to thank them warmly for having
acquitted themselves so splendidly. Tom Sherwood,
in particular, squeezed his hand with
peculiar emphasis at parting, as he said in a
happy tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a white letter night for me,
Hugh, and one I&rsquo;ll never, never forget. You
know why, Hugh, and the first thing to-morrow
morning I&rsquo;m going to buy those Belgian
hares back if they are still in the market. So
good night, and thank you a thousand times,
Hugh. It&rsquo;s bound to be a happy birthday for
me, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">FOR HOME PROTECTION.</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning, when the news
was circulated through Oakvale that some of
the disorderly elements had attempted to make
a raid on the Ainslee jewelry establishment,
great was the consternation of the good people
of the town. Then when it was added that
the supposed robbery was only a part of a
miserable scheme to try and bring the organization
of Boy Scouts into disrepute, the indignation
of the citizens knew no bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the culminating stroke of wickedness,&rdquo;
Mrs. Marsh declared as she spoke at a hurriedly
arranged meeting of the best ladies in
the town, &ldquo;and proves that we did not commence
this uplift movement a day too soon!
Heaven only knows what might not have happened
if not for those dear boys making up
their minds that conditions had to change in
Oakvale. I am free to confess that all our efforts
to arouse the citizens had been marked
by little success until Hugh and his comrades
took it upon themselves to start the ball rolling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Dobbs, the minister, who
chanced to be present so as to congratulate the
Ladies&rsquo; League on the splendid success that
was meeting their efforts, &ldquo;it has often seemed
to me that when Providence wants to overwhelm
bad men in the toils, first of all their
common sense is taken away so that they commit
foolish acts that bring about their own
downfall. By great good luck we have managed
to turn the tables on these schemers, and
they are hoist by their own petard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after what has happened,&rdquo; added Mrs.
Beverly earnestly, &ldquo;there should not be a single
dissenting citizen who cares a shred about his
or her reputation. Bold, indeed, must the man
or woman be who would dare side with such
desperate rascals as Gaffney and Slimmons.
The town is well rid of an encumbrance, and
let us all be thankful in our hearts on this wonderful
day that the sun can look down on our
beautiful little city and not shine on a single
evil spot. Our boys and girls can go to and
fro from this time on without that constant
anxiety mothers have been feeling. I wish to
state that much of this sense of security, I believe,
we owe to the sterling efforts of Hugh
Hardin and his sturdy comrades of Oakvale
Troop. I love every one of them, and shall
never be weary of sounding their praises, for
they are boys of whom any town might well be
proud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>It is human nature to want to be on the winning
side. Hugh believed there would be comparatively
little trouble ahead for himself and
comrades. The rapidity with which the men
who had been taken to the lockup were brought
to trial and punished for their misdeeds was
going to deter others from attempting opposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>In the midst of all this excitement, together
with so much cause for congratulation, Hugh
did not forget Tom Sherwood, and what had
happened to brighten his life. The next time
he met Tom he found his face radiant with
the joy of living. Any one could see without
being much of a reader of human nature that
Tom was thoroughly happy. Many were the
conjectures that his friends gave as to the reason
for the boy&rsquo;s sudden return to his old self.
Tom kept his own counsel, and only told those
who persisted in asking questions that a little
trouble he had had on his mind had come out
all right.</p>
<p>Hugh would keep the secret, of that Tom
felt assured, and no one need ever know what
terrible fears he had been entertaining on account
of Benjy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; he went on to say, as he clapped his
hand on the shoulder of the scout master, with
a movement that stood for deep affection, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all come out right, and I&rsquo;m the happiest fellow
in Oakvale, let me tell you. Benjy and I understand
each other now, and I&rsquo;ll see to it that
after this never a cloud is going to come between
us. Hugh, he&rsquo;s going to drop over tonight
to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t know that I felt worried
about him the same way you did, Tom?&rdquo; remarked
Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I was too ashamed of my fears to ever
tell him about <i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied the other, quickly.
&ldquo;Benjy has been explaining to me what a fight
he had with himself before he could break off
connections with that crowd. I think a dream
he had one night had a heap to do with his
making a decision. He wouldn&rsquo;t explain just
what it was, only shuddered as he spoke of it.
You can govern yourself as you think best,
Hugh, when you&rsquo;re talking with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never learn a single thing from me
about your worrying, Tom. Although you
haven&rsquo;t said so, I imagine he&rsquo;s coming to make
some inquiries about joining the scouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s got in mind now,
Hugh. He&rsquo;s found himself interested in a lot
of things we&rsquo;ve been doing the last year or so.
Somehow, they seem to look different from
what they used to. Benjy has waked up, you
see, and once a fellow gets to feel an interest
in scout doings he&rsquo;s bound to go on wanting to
know more. When the fever begins to burn
in his veins he never finds any rest until he
throws his lot in with the wearers of the khaki,
and starts to learn things for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I expect to be home to-night after
supper,&rdquo; said the scout master, &ldquo;and will be
glad to have him drop over. We need a few
more good fellows to fill out the vacancies in
several of the patrols. Lieutenant Denmead,
you understand, may be home the end of this
week, and assume his old position of head of
the troop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be surprised to learn what&rsquo;s been
going on here during his absence, believe me,&rdquo;
observed Tom, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I keep in touch with him, and I&rsquo;ve written
an inkling of what we&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo;
Hugh admitted. &ldquo;All the same he&rsquo;ll be pleased
to find Oakvale so changed. The ladies say it
must never go back again to where it was
before. We scouts are of the same mind.
Homes are going to be protected against those
whose evil influence is all for pulling them
down. That&rsquo;s going to be the slogan of the
scouts from now on. Tom, every new member
we take in means one more timber in the structure
we&rsquo;re building on this safe foundation.
Work all you can to spread the gospel of scout
activities. There are dozens of fellows still
around town who ought to be given an opportunity
to learn the great benefits that go with
scout membership.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>When Benjy came around that same evening,
Hugh was primed for him. He went
about his task with diplomacy, knowing that
some boys can be led but never driven. So successfully
did Hugh accomplish his labors that
before Tom Sherwood&rsquo;s younger brother left
the house he was fairly wild to have his name
brought before the nominating committee at
the very next meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that I&rsquo;ve already lost a mighty fine
time by my silly opposition to the scouts,&rdquo;
Benjy frankly admitted. &ldquo;I was all wrong,
and I guess it was only my natural pig-headedness
that kept me so. But I&rsquo;ve seen a great
light, Hugh. They say it&rsquo;s better late than
never. I want to enjoy some of those good
times you fellows have. Besides, I expect I&rsquo;ve
got something to wipe out, because of late I&rsquo;ve
given my brother Tom more or less worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a scout goes about recruiting in the
happy way Hugh did there is hardly a limit to
his capacity for bringing new members into a
troop. Those boys of Oakvale who wore the
khaki had been highly favored by fortune in
that opportunities for doing big things had ever
knocked at their door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Those readers who have had the pleasure of
enjoying many of the previous books in this
series will remember with satisfaction how
they followed the fortunes of Hugh and his
chums at the time they set out to improve the
sanitary conditions of the community in which
they lived.</p>
<p>Then there was the time of the great flood
in a neighbouring town where several of the
boys chanced to be visiting, during which they
proved that they were made of the right kind
of stuff, and won the admiration of the people
of the inundated district.</p>
<p>The temptation is strong to mention several
other instances where scout pluck and
endurance won the day against heavy odds.
For example, there was the time when the
lads were camping in the vicinity of a great
plant where a strike broke out, and rioting resulted.
It may be remembered how they took
hold and showed what they knew of &ldquo;first aid
to the injured,&rdquo; winning the approbation of
the Red Cross doctor and nurses when later on
they came upon the scene.</p>
<p>During the County Fair the scouts also
played a part that made them many new
friends, acting as messengers and guides to
the exhibitors and visitors, and even running
a successful field hospital in the fair grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>To continue a little further it may also be
remembered how they were unexpectedly
called upon to fight the forest fires that threatened
to ruin many farmers and others who had
their homes within reach of the flames. Those
boys who read that story will not soon forget
how Hugh and his mates acted their part
against heavy odds, and how splendidly they
convinced a doubter that scout activities always
made a boy more manly, as well as rendered
him a far better citizen, of which any
community might well be proud.</p>
<p>Then there was the time some of the Oakvale
boys in khaki met with a remarkable adventure
in connection with the motion picture
players, which has been narrated at length in
a recent volume.</p>
<p>Last, but far from least, while mentioning
some of these interesting and instructive facts,
it would hardly be fair to omit the occasion,
not so far in the past, when some of those
same fellows earned the right to have their
names written on the Scouts&rsquo; Roll of Honor,
as well as managed to receive the valuable
medal which is presented to those members in
good standing who save human life at the risk
of their own. If you have not already enjoyed
reading that story lose no time in securing
it, as you will be well repaid for your
time and money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>But passing over these never-to-be-forgotten
happenings of the past we must once more
come back to Hugh and his chums at the time
they labored so zealously to create a new moral
atmosphere in the home town where they lived,
and of which they were naturally very fond.</p>
<p>As the spring days went on the difficulties
that had at first beset the reform wave in Oakvale
gradually died down, until it seemed as
though things were going along like clockwork.
Men, women and children took a keen interest
in helping the matter along. There was a
healthy rivalry between certain cliques of boys
with the idea of winning the highest praise for
keeping their section of the town free from all
nuisances, and so long as this spirit lived, the
community was bound to profit.</p>
<p>Once the citizens began to enjoy full freedom
from repulsive and unpleasant customs,
they found the change so agreeable that no one
had the temerity to sigh for the old r&eacute;gime; at
least, if he did, he wisely kept his longings to
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Even the railroad company, that had up to
that time absolutely refused to do anything
that would necessitate the expenditure of
money, seemed to have been shamed by the action
of the scouts in looking after those dangerous
spots, where the lives of the smaller
school children were placed in danger.</p>
<p>First, a gate guarded by a flagman was
placed at the point of most danger. That was
an entering wedge, and as the citizens sent in
a letter of thanks for the favor the railroad
people awoke to the fact that the Oakvale station
was a pretty dingy-looking affair after all.
To the surprise and delight of the population
word was received that it had been unanimously
decided at the last meeting of the Directors
to build the finest station on the whole
line, of course outside the big cities, at Oakvale.</p>
<p>One portion of that communication made
some fellows in Oakvale feel pretty well satisfied,
for it was hung up where every one could
read it who wished. This ran after the following
fashion, and few there were in Oakvale
who did not know the wording by heart, most
of them were so proud of the distinction:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;We desire to state for the benefit of those
who may have doubted the substantial benefit
of a certain movement that has been sweeping
over the land, that one of the chief reasons
why Oakvale is selected for the honor of this
new and beautiful station is the fact that her
citizens have in their midst an organization
that has done wonders in improving the living
conditions in their town. We refer to the local
scout troop; and wish to say that having
after a full investigation learned how loyally
these boys have striven to do their duty, and
served as best they knew how to uplift the
community in which they lived, it is our earnest
hope that other towns and villages along
our line may take pattern of these boys of
Oakvale, and hasten to emulate their splendid
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That letter was deemed so precious a recommendation
that Hugh afterwards obtained the
right to have it suitably framed. And to this
day it hangs in the meeting-room of the Oakvale
Scouts, where any member of the troop
will esteem it a privilege to show it to you if
you take the trouble to drop around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Every time Hugh saw Tom on the tennis
court swinging that splendid new racquet, he
told himself how unsafe it was for any one to
judge wholly from appearances, and that he
must consider the delightful outcome of that
little affair as a never-to-be-forgotten lesson.
Circumstantial evidence has hung many a man
who was afterward found to be innocent.
Hugh shivered to remember how Tom, yes,
and he himself, had been condemning Benjy
as they might a criminal when, in reality, the
other was only working out a noble scheme to
surprise his brother.</p>
<p>One thing must not be forgotten. Hugh&mdash;believing
that Tom, in his spirit of brotherly
love, might hasten to buy back those Belgian
hares for Benjy, and thus in a measure weaken
the spirit of sacrifice, that had made the other
sell his pets&mdash;went around to the bird store
early on the next morning, and purchased the
pair of long-eared animals. He planned to
keep them for a while, and then let Tom have
them to give to Benjy on his next birthday, for
by that time the other would have obtained all
the good possible from his impulsive action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Hugh would have liked very well to have
told the story for the sake of the great good it
might do several other fellows whom he knew.
This was not to be considered for a minute,
he had too great a consideration for Tom and
his brother to think of causing them embarrassment,
as most likely they must have experienced
had their story become common property.</p>
<p>Hugh had already begun to figure on the
summer campaign, knowing that the boys
would naturally expect to busy themselves with
something useful as well as entertaining. In
the end he was able to lay out a plan that he
believed would meet with unanimous approval.
Since it is about time for me to end this story,
there is no need of going into particulars.
When the time comes to again write of the
Oakvale Scouts&rsquo; activities we shall expect to
enter at length into the new schemes that
would naturally enlist their attention. At such
date we hope to again meet Hugh and his gallant
chums of the Wolf, Otter, Hawk, Fox and
Owl Patrols. Until then let it be adieu, but
not farewell.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
